title: Presenting at PgEast

I'm excited to be going to the upcoming PostgreSQL East Conference.  This will be both my first PostgreSQL conference to attend, as well as my first time presenting.  I will be giving a talk on [Bucardo](http://bucardo.org) entitled [Bucardo: More than Just Multi-Master](https://www.postgresqlconference.org/content/bucardo-more-just-multi-master).  I'll be in NYC for the conference, so I'll get to work for a couple days at our company's main office as well.

I look forward to learning more about PostgreSQL, putting some names and faces with some IRC nicks, and socializing with others in the PostgreSQL community; after all, Postgres' community is one of its strongest assets.

Hope to see you there!
