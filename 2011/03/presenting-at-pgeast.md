I’m excited to be going to the upcoming PostgreSQL East Conference. This will be both my first PostgreSQL conference to attend, as well as my first time presenting. I will be giving a talk on [Bucardo](https://bucardo.org/Bucardo/) entitled [Bucardo: More than Just Multi-Master](http://www.postgresqlconference.org/content/bucardo-more-just-multi-master). I’ll be in NYC for the conference, so I’ll get to work for a couple days at our company’s main office as well.

I look forward to learning more about PostgreSQL, putting some names and faces with some IRC nicks, and socializing with others in the PostgreSQL community; after all, Postgres’ community is one of its strongest assets.

Hope to see you there!
