title: Liquid Galaxy Project in GSoC 2011!
---



We're very happy to announce The Liquid Galaxy Project has been [accepted](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/program/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc2011) as a Mentoring Organization for the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Program!

Talented students interested in Liquid Galaxy, panoramic systems, and the opportunity to be paid a stipend of $5000 by Google to develop and enhance open source code should go to the project's Ideas Page and make a proposal to the project for review:

We look forward to student submissions on these exciting projects that will make Liquid Galaxy an even more impressive system, including:

- Controlling Liquid Galaxy with novel input devices like a Wiimote, Android phone, or Kinect
- Patching other open-source software enabling multi-system panoramic display
- Production of panoramic video, audio, and photography
- Your own innovative idea!
