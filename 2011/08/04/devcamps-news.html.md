DevCamps is a system for managing development, integration, staging, and production environments. It was developed by End Point for, and with the help of, some of our ecommerce clients. It grew over the space of several years, and really started to become its own standalone project in 2007.

Camps are a behind-the-scenes workhorse of our web application development at End Point, and don’t always get much attention because everyone’s too busy using camps to get work done! But this summer a few things are happening.

In early July we unveiled a redesign of the devcamps.org website that features a more whimsical look, a better explanation of what camps are all about, and endorsements by business and developer users. Marko Bijelic of [Hipinspire](http://hipinspire.com/) did the design. Take a look:

In less than two weeks, on August 17, I’m going to be giving a [talk on camps](https://web.archive.org/web/20110917034518/http://yapceurope.lv/ye2011/talk/3629) at YAPC::EU in Riga, Latvia. YAPC::EU is Europe’s annual Perl conference, and will be a nice place to talk about camps.

Many Perl developers are doing web applications, which is camps’ main focus, so that’s reason enough. But camps also started around the [Interchange](http://www.icdevgroup.org/i/dev) application server, which is written in Perl. And the camp system is currently implemented in Perl as well.

We’ve set up a lot of camp systems for Perl web applications. So even though we’ve also set up camp systems for web applications using Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, Django, and PHP, it’s a nice homecoming to talk about camps to Perl enthusiasts.
