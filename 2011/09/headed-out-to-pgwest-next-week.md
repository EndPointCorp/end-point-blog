I’m gearing up to go out to San Jose to attend and speak at the PG West PostgreSQL conference in sunny San Jose. (Does anyone have directions...?)

I’m excited to again meet and mingle with more PostgreSQL experts and enthusiasts and look forward to the various talks, technical discussions, and social opportunities. My talk will be on [Bucardo](https://bucardo.org/) and many uses for it as a general tool. It’ll also cover additional changes coming down the pipe in Bucardo 5.

I look forward to seeing everyone!
