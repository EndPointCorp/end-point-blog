Wow, time flies, [Postgres Open](https://web.archive.org/web/20110927094014/http://www.postgresopen.org/2011/home/) is almost upon us!

I’ll be there giving a talk Thursday morning on [monitoring tools and techniques](https://web.archive.org/web/20111129050654/http://postgresopen.org/2011/schedule/presentations/60/), and possibly helping with the [Bucardo 5 replication](https://web.archive.org/web/20111129045834/http://postgresopen.org/2011/schedule/presentations/55/) session Friday afternoon. Sadly I’ll need need to catch a flight shortly after that, so there won’t be much time to explore Chicago around everything going on. But at least it’ll be nice to get out to a conference again!
