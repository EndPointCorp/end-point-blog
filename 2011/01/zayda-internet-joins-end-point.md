End Point is pleased to announce the merging of web hosting firm Zayda Internet into our company as of December 2010.

Zayda Internet was a small hosting company that started in 1999 and focused on Linux web and email hosting and consulting for many small businesses and individuals, and a few larger sites including most prominently the busy community site [OSNews.com](http://www.osnews.com/).

Weâ€™re happy to welcome all Zayda Internet customers into the End Point fold and look forward to working with them in the future.
