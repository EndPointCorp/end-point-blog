The other day Sonny Cook and I were troubleshooting some YUI JavaScript code and looking at some fairly complex JSON. It would obviously be a lot easier to read if each nested data structure were indented, and spacing standardized.

I threw together a little Perl program based on the JSON man page:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl

use JSON;

my $json = JSON->new;
undef $/;
while (<>) {
    print $json->pretty->encode($json->decode($_));
}
```

It took all of 2 or 3 minutes and I even left out strictures and warnings. Living on the edge!

It turns a mess like this (sample from json.org):

```javascript
{"glossary":{"title":"example glossary","GlossDiv":{"title":"S","GlossList":
{"GlossEntry":{"ID":"SGML","SortAs":"SGML","GlossTerm":"Standard Generalized Markup Language",
"Acronym":"SGML","Abbrev":"ISO 8879:1986","GlossDef":{"para":
"A meta-markup language,used to create markup languages such as DocBook.",
"GlossSeeAlso":["GML","XML"]},"GlossSee":"markup"}}}}}
```

into this much more readable specimen:

```javascript
{
   "glossary" : {
      "GlossDiv" : {
         "GlossList" : {
            "GlossEntry" : {
               "GlossDef" : {
                  "para" : "A meta-markup language,used to create markup languages such as DocBook.",
                  "GlossSeeAlso" : [
                     "GML",
                     "XML"
                  ]
               },
               "GlossTerm" : "Standard Generalized Markup Language",
               "ID" : "SGML",
               "SortAs" : "SGML",
               "Acronym" : "SGML",
               "Abbrev" : "ISO 8879:1986",
               "GlossSee" : "markup"
            }
         },
         "title" : "S"
      },
      "title" : "example glossary"
   }
}
```

But today I thought back to that and figured surely something like that must already be at hand if Iâ€™d just looked for it. Sure enough, there are many easy options that work conveniently from the shell, similarly to that script:

- json_xs (Perl JSON::XS)
- python -mjson.tool (Python 2.6+)
- prettify_json.rb (Ruby json gem)

And those were just the ones that were likely already on the machine I was using! Hooray for convenience.
