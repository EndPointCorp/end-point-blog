We just returned from Nashville after bringing [Liquid Galaxy](https://liquidgalaxy.endpoint.com/) to the 2017 BOMA International Annual Conference & Expo. Commercial real estate has always been a seamless fit for Liquid Galaxy due to the system’s ability to showcase real estate and property data in an interactive and panoramic setting.  Within real estate, Liquid Galaxy was first used by CBRE and has since been adopted by Hilton, JLL, and Prologis to name a few.

In preparation for BOMA (Building Owners and Managers Association), we prepared sample commercial real estate content on our content management system to be displayed on the Liquid Galaxy. This included the creation of content about Hudson Yards, the new development being built in lower Manhattan.

The content that was created demonstrates how brokers and directors at commercial real estate companies can tell an immersive, panoramic, and interactive story to their potential clients and investors. Future developments can be shown in developing areas, and with the content management system you can create stories that include videos, images, and 3D models of these future developments. The following video demonstrates this well:

We were able to effectively showcase our ability to incorporate 3D models and mapping layers at BOMA through the use of Google Earth, Cesium, ArcGIS, Unity, and Sketchfab. We were also able to pull data and develop content for neighboring booths and visitors, demonstrating what an easy and data-agnostic platform Liquid Galaxy can be.

We’re very excited about the increasing traction we have in the real estate industry, and hope our involvement with BOMA will take that to the next level.
