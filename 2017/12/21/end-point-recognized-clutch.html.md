As the year comes to a close and we reflect on the goals we’ve accomplished and the work that made it all possible, we are proud to announce our inclusion on the Clutch Global Leaders List, encapsulating the 475+ most highly reviewed companies from around the world. We placed as a leader on both Top Ruby on Rails Developers and Top Ecommerce Developers, being the best New York-based firm on the former and in the top three from New York on the latter.

Achieving the status of a Clutch Global Leader in not just one, but two categories speaks volumes on the effort we’ve put forth in 2017. We couldn’t have hit this milestone without skilled work from End Point staff and the great relationships we’ve nurtured with clients. Looking back on these memorable projects, here are some of the things are clients wrote on our Clutch profile:

> “I’ve worked with a lot of different service providers. Results can vary across the board. End Point is very transparent about what they’re working on in terms of providing complete details. We don’t have any surprises at the end of the month as a result. They’re very dependable, delivering what they promise every time,” explained the Director of Ecommerce for a tourism marketing company.

They went on to describe our flexibility and close partnership:

> “Many of their team members are instrumental in helping us keep doing everything that we need. Our business evolves and changes. They help us make sure that what we’re building is up to snuff, and scales well with our company. We’ve grown considerably since we’ve hired them.”

Another client, the owner of a B2B platform, commented on our project management expertise and what it was like to work with our team:

> “I am very satisfied with End Point. They are a fantastic company to work with. Their engineers are outstanding, their communication skills are excellent, and the delivery speed is great. I have nothing but good things to say about their company.”
