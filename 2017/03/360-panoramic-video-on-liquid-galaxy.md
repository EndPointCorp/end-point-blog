End Point’s [Liquid Galaxy](https://liquidgalaxy.endpoint.com/) recently had an exciting breakthrough! We can now show 360° panoramic video effectively and seamlessly on our Liquid Galaxy systems.

Since our integration of seamless 360° panovideo, our marketing and content teams have been loading up our system with the best 360° panoramic videos. The Liquid Galaxy system at our headquarter office has 360° panoramic videos from National Geographic, The New York Times, Google Spotlight, gaming videos, and more.

The technical challenge with panoramic video is to get multiple instances of the video player app to work in sync.  On the Liquid Galaxy, you're actually seeing 7 different video player apps all running at the same time and playing the same video file, but with each app showing a slightly adjusted slice of the 360° panoramic video.  This synchronization and angle-adjustment is at the heart of the Liquid Galaxy platform, and allows a high-resolution experience and surrounding immersion that doesn't happen on any other video wall system.

We anticipate that our flawless 360° panoramic video will resonate with many industries, one of whom is the gaming industry. Below we’ve included a video of 360° gaming videos, and how they appear on Liquid Galaxy. Mixed with all the other exciting capabilities on Liquid Galaxy, we anticipate the ability to view angle-adjusted and 3D-immersive 360° video on the system will be a huge crowd-pleaser.
