### Why I’m doing this?

I often see that people use AngularJS and Angular names interchangeably. It’s an obvious mistake for someone familiar with the front-end programming.

If you don’t believe me (why would you?) just go to the [Angular team repository](https://github.com/angular) or Wikipedia ([Angular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_(application_platform)) and [AngularJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS)).

### AngularJS (1.X)

**AngularJS** is a popular open-source JavaScript framework created by Miško Hevery released in 2010 that was subsequently taken over by Google. It’s not the same thing as **Angular**. The latest stable version of the framework is 1.6.6.

### Angular (2+)

**Angular** is an open-source TypeScript-based framework created by Google from scratch. It’s been totally rewritten and **not** compatible with **AngularJS**. The latest stable version of the framework is 4.4.4. They started from version 2 to avoid even more confusion.

### Summary

I feel I have made the world better. Go now and correct everyone (it’s such fun)!
