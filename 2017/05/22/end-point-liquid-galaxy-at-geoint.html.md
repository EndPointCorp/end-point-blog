[End Point Liquid Galaxy](https://liquidgalaxy.endpoint.com/) will be coming to San Antonio to participate in GEOINT 2017 Symposium. We are excited to demonstrate our geospatial capabilities on an immersive and panoramic 7 screen Liquid Galaxy system. We will be exhibiting at booth #1012 from June 4-7.

On the Liquid Galaxy, complex data sets can be explored and analyzed in a 3D immersive fly-through environment.  Presentations can highlight specific data layers combined with video, 3D models, and browsers for maximum communications efficiency. The end result is a rich, highly immersive, and engaging way to experience your data.

Liquid Galaxy’s extensive capabilities include ArcGIS, Cesium, Google Maps, Google Earth, LIDAR point clouds, realtime data integration, 360 panoramic video, and more. The system always draws huge crowds at conferences; people line up to try out the system for themselves.

End Point has deployed Liquid Galaxy systems around the world. This includes many high profile clients, such as Google, NOAA, CBRE, National Air & Space Museum, Hyundai, and Barclays. Our clients utilize our content management system to create immersive and interactive presentations that tell engaging stories to their users.

[GEOINT](http://geoint2017.com/) is hosted and produced by the United States Geospatial Intelligence Foundation (USGIF). It is the nation’s largest gathering of industry, academia, and government to include Defense, Intelligence and Homeland Security communities as well as commercial, Fed/Civil, State and Local geospatial intelligence stakeholders.

We look forward to meeting you at booth #1012 at GEOINT. In the meantime, if you have any questions please visit [our website](https://liquidgalaxy.endpoint.com/) or email [ask@endpoint.com](ask@endpoint.com).
