title: Liquid Galaxy at CES
---

This past week, End Point attended and exhibited at [CES](https://www.ces.tech/), a global consumer electronics and consumer technology tradeshow that takes place every January in Las Vegas, Nevada. End Point’s [Liquid Galaxy](https://liquidgalaxy.endpoint.com/) was set up in the [Gigabyte](http://www.gigabyte.us/?f=g) exhibit at Caesar’s Palace.

Gigabyte invited us to set up a Liquid Galaxy in their exhibit space because they believe the Liquid Galaxy is the best show-piece for their Brix hardware. The Brix, or “[Brix GTX Pro](http://www.gigabyte.us/products/product-page.aspx?pid=6076#ov)” in this case, offers an Intel i7 6th gen processor and NVIDIA GTX950 graphics (for high performance applications, such as gaming) hardware in a small and sleek package (12 in. length, 9 in. width, 1 in. height). Since each Brix GTX Pro offers 4 display outputs, we only needed two Brix to run all 7 screens and touchscreen, and one Brix to power the headnode!

This was the first time we have powered a Liquid Galaxy with Gigabyte Brix units, and the hardware proved to be extremely effective. It is a significantly sleeker solution than hardware situated in a server rack. It is also very cost-effective.

We created custom content for Gigabyte on our Content Management System. An video of one of our custom presentations can be viewed below. We built the presentation so the the GTX Pro product webpage was on the left-most screen, and the GTX Pro landing webpage was on the right-most screen. A custom Gigabyte video built for CES covered the center three screens. The Gigabyte logo was put on the 2nd screen to the left. In the background, the system was set to orbit on Google Earth. This presentation built for Gigabyte, which includes graphics, webpages, videos, and KML, demonstrates many of the capabilities of End Point’s Content Management System and the Liquid Galaxy.

In addition to being a visually dazzling display tool for Gigabyte to show off to its network of customers and partners, Liquid Galaxy was a fantastic way for Gigabyte to showcase the power of their Brix hardware. The opportunity to collaborate with Gigabyte on the Liquid Galaxy was a welcome one, and we look forward to further collaboration.
