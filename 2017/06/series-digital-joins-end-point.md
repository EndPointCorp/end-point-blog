End Point has the pleasure to announce some very big news!

After an amicable wooing period, End Point has purchased the software consulting company [Series Digital](http://www.seriesdigital.com/), a NYC-based firm that designs and builds custom software solutions. Over the past decade, Series Digital has automated business processes, brought new ideas to market, and built large-scale dynamic infrastructure.

Series Digital launched in 2006 in New York City. From the start, Series Digital managed large database installations for financial services clients such as Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, and Citigroup. They also worked with startups including Drop.io, Byte, Mode Analytics, Domino, and Brewster.

These growth-focused, data-intensive businesses benefited from Series Digital’s expertise in scalable infrastructure, project management, and information security. Today, Series Digital supports clients across many major industry sectors and has focused its development efforts on the Microsoft .NET ecosystem. They have strong design and user experience expertise. Their client list is global.

The Series Digital team began working at End Point on April 3rd, 2017.

The CEO of Series Digital is Jonathan Blessing. He joins End Point’s leadership team as  Director of Client Engagements. End Point has had a relationship with Jonathan since 2010, and looks forward with great anticipation to the role he will play expanding End Point’s consulting business.

To help support End Point’s expansion into .NET solutions, End Point has hired [Dan Briones](/team/dan-briones), a 25-year veteran of IT infrastructure engineering, to serve as Project and Team Manager for the Series Digital group. Dan started working with End Point at the end of March.

The End Point leadership team is very excited by the addition of Dan, Jonathan, and the rest of the talented Series Digital team: Jon Allen, Ed Huott, Dylan Wooters, Vasile Laur, Liz Flyntz, Andrew Grosser, William Yeack, and Ian Neilsen.

End Point’s reputation has been built upon its excellence in e-commerce, managed infrastructure, and database support. We are excited by the addition of Series Digital, which both deepens those abilities, and allows us to offer new services.
