End Point had the privilege of participating in [The Ocean Conference](https://oceanconference.un.org/) at the United Nations, hosted by the [International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)](https://www.iucn.org/), these past two weeks. The health of the oceans is critical, and The Ocean Conference, the first United Nations conference on this issue, presents a unique and invaluable opportunity for the world to reverse the precipitous decline of the health of the oceans and seas with concrete solutions.

A Liquid Galaxy was set up in a prominent area on the main floor of the United Nations. End Point created custom content for the Ocean Conference, using the Liquid Galaxy’s Content Management System. Visiting diplomats and government officials were able to experience this content — Liquid Galaxy’s interactive panoramic setup allows visitors to feel immersed in the different locations, with video and information spanning their periphery.

Liquid Galaxy content created for The Ocean Conference included:

* A study of the Catlin Seaview Survey and how the world’s coral reefs are changing
* 360 panoramic underwater videos
* All Mission Blue Ocean Hope Spots
* A guided tour of the Monaco Explorations 3 Year Expedition
* National Marine Sanctuaries around the United States

We were grateful to be able to create content for such a good cause, and hope to be able to do more good work for the IUCN and the UN! If you’d like to learn more, please visit [our website](https://liquidgalaxy.endpoint.com/) or email [ask@endpoint.com](mailto:ask@endpoint.com).
