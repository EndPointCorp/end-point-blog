The President of UN General Assembly, Peter Thomson, thanked End Point for supporting the [Ocean Conference](https://oceanconference.un.org/), which was held at the United Nations Headquarters this past summer to bring attention and action to saving the world’s oceans.

End Point’s [Liquid Galaxy](https://liquidgalaxy.endpoint.com/) helped bring to life “Reconnecting Humanity to the Sea,” an exhibition meant to showcase the beauty of the ocean and the challenges it faces today.
