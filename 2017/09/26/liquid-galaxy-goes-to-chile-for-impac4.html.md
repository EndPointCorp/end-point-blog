Marine Protected Areas: Bringing the people and ocean together

Earlier this month, [The Marine Conservation Institute](https://marine-conservation.org/) and the [Waitt Foundation](http://waittfoundation.org/) brought a [Liquid Galaxy](https://liquidgalaxy.endpoint.com/) to Chile to showcase interactive and panoramic ocean content at the Fourth International Marine Protected Areas Congress in La Serena.  This conference was a convergence of marine biologists, ocean agencies, and environmentalists from around the globe to discuss the state of and future development initiatives of Marine Protected Areas worldwide.

 The Marine Conservation Institute is working on a mapping project called MPAtlas that visually catalogs the development of Marine Protected Areas across the globe as well as the Global Ocean Refuge System which pushes for elevated standards for Marine Protected Areas and advocates for a 30% protected marine ecosystem by 2030.

We built new content to showcase the GLORES areas in Google Earth as well as data visualizations of the global system of Marine Protected Areas.  In addition, we collected any past oceanographic related content we’ve developed for the Liquid Galaxy platform.  This included underwater panoramic media from the [Catlin Seaview Survey](http://catlinseaviewsurvey.com/), [Mission Blue Hope Spots](https://www.mission-blue.org/hope-spots/), Google Street View collections of underwater photos such as this project which catalogs the [Great Barrier Reef.](https://www.google.com/maps/about/behind-the-scenes/streetview/treks/oceans/)

Aside from showcasing this curated content, the Liquid Galaxy served as a comprehensive interactive tool for scientists and environmentalists to showcase their research areas during the break periods between lectures and events occurring at the Congress.  Since the Liquid Galaxy utilizes the entire globe, conference attendees were able to free fly to their respective research and/or proposed protected areas as an impromptu presentation aid and further explore underwater terrain and panoramic media in their location.

The Liquid Galaxy platform is featured in museums and aquariums around the world, and we are thrilled that it is being used as a tool to study and conserve oceans and nature. We recently had the opportunity to participate in [The Ocean Conference at the United Nations](/blog/2017/06/19/liquid-galaxy-at-ocean-conference), and are excited the system continues to be utilized to study and prevent future detrimental changes to our planet. We hope to have more opportunities to create content geared toward nature conservation, as well as opportunities to share the Liquid Galaxy with environmentalists so that the system will continue be used as a tool for visualizing research data in new and interesting ways.
