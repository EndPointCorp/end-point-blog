title: 'Another Round of Tidbits: Browser Tools, Performance, UI'
---

It's [been a while](/blog/2013/11/13/internal-tidbits-links-resources-tools) since I shared a blog article where I share End Point *tidbits*, or bits of information passed around the [End Point team](/team) that don't necessarily merit a single blog post, but are worth mentioning and archiving. Here are some notes shared since that last post that I've been collecting:

- [Skeuocard](http://kenkeiter.com/skeuocard/) and [creditcard.js](http://creditcardjs.com/) are intuitive user interface (JS, CSS) plugins for credit card form inputs (card number, security code, billing name).

- [StackExchange UX](http://ux.stackexchange.com/) is a Stack Overflow resource for user interface Q&A.
- [wpgrep](http://blogs.perl.org/users/brian_d_foy/2013/12/grepping-my-wordpress-database.html) is an available tool for grepping through WordPress databases.
- [Here](http://sideeffect.kr/popularconvention/) is a nifty little tool that analyzes GitHub commits to report on language convention, e.g. space vs. tab indentation & spacing in argument definitions.

- [Ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) (The Silver Searcher) is a document searching tool similar to ack, with improved speed. There's also a [Ag plugin for vim](https://github.com/rking/ag.vim).
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) released [Atom](https://atom.io/) earlier this year. Atom is a desktop application text editor; features include Node.js support, modular design, and a full feature list to compete with existing text editors.
- [SpeedCurve](http://speedcurve.com/) is a web performance tool built on [WebPagetest](http://www.webpagetest.org/) data. It focuses on providing a beautiful user interface and minimizing data storage.

- [Here](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/07/22/responsive-web-design-should-not-be-your-only-mobile-strategy/) is an interesting article by [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/) discussing mobile strategy for web design. It covers a wide range of challenges that come up in mobile web development.
- [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/), [deck.js](http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/), [Impress.js](http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js/), [Shower](http://shwr.me/), and [showoff](https://github.com/puppetlabs/showoff) are a few open source tools available for in-browser presentation support.
- Have you seen [Firefox's 3D view](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/3D_View)? It's a 3D representation of the DOM hierarchy. I'm a little skeptical of its value, but the documentation outlines a few use cases such as identifying broken HTML and finding stray elements.

- [Here](http://letsworkshop.com/the-email-line/) is an interesting article discussing how to approach sales by presenting a specific solution and alternative solutions to clients, rather than the generic "Let me know how I can help." approach.
- A coworker inquired looking for web based SMS providers to send text messages to customer cellphones. Responses included services recommended such as [txtwire](http://txtwire.com/), [twilio](http://www.twilio.com/sms), [The Callr](http://thecallr.com/en/products/api-json-voice-sms/), and [Clickatell](https://www.clickatell.com/).
