End Point was proud to present the Liquid Galaxy for the French Golf Federation at this yearâ€™s Ryder Cup in Gleneagles, Scotland. The French Golf Federation will be hosting the cup in 2018 at Le Golf National, which is just outside of Paris and is also the current venue of the French Open.

Throughout the event, thousands of people came in and tried out the Liquid Galaxy. The platform displayed one of its many hidden talents and allowed golf fans from around the world to find and show off their home courses. One of the most interesting things to witness was watching golf course designers accurately guess the date of the satellite imagery based on which course changes were present.

This deployment presented special challenges: a remote location (the bustling tented village adjacent to the course) with a combination of available hardware from our European partners and a shipment from our Tennessee office.  Despite these challenges, we assembled the system, negotiated the required network connectivity, deployed the custom interface, and delivered a great display for our sponsoring partners. The event was a great success and all enjoyed the unseasonably mild Scottish weather.
