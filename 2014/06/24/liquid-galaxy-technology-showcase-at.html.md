title: Liquid Galaxy Technology Showcase at Situation Interactive
---



Situation Interactive hosted its first Annual Tech Showcase on June 10th to continue its ongoing event series that promotes innovation through community collaboration.

End Point Liquid Galaxy was chosen to be one of three technology companies to show off its interactive display platform to Situationâ€™s internal staff and a select group of clients. We were selected as a company that represents an exciting innovative technology. Our presentation focused on the various features of the Liquid Galaxy, including:

- Google Earth navigation with digital content overlays
- Panoramic photography and videos using krPano
- 3D modeling within Google Earth
- Customized tours 

As you can see in the photos below, participants were able to view any part of Google Earth, pano photos, and even the interior of leading museums and coral reefs (as Google Street View expands beyond just the sidewalks).

This Tech Showcase gave us an opportunity to show off these new features of the Liquid Galaxy to potential partners and clients. We are always happy to work with our friends at Situation, who have been our longstanding clients for a few years now. We look forward to growing our relationships with other creative agencies and entertainment venues. Do you work at a creative agency? Do you think the Liquid Galaxy might fit in with your plans or designs? Please contact us at [sales@endpoint.com](mailto:sales@endpoint.com).
