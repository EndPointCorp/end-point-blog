The Winter Olympics are in full swing in Pyongchang, Korea!  We’re proud to note that we have a full Liquid Galaxy running onsite there as well. Our Seoul-based partner, Azero, has been working closely with KEPCO, the Korean power company, to bring Liquid Galaxies to several of their visitor centers scattered throughout South Korea.  KEPCO utilizes the Liquid Galaxy to showcase their infrastructure elements of hydroelectric dams, large power stations, and substations to show how they bring electricity to the 40M+ people living in South Korea.

As a lead corporate sponsor of the games, KEPCO proudly wanted to bring that same story to the Olympic venues. AZero developed new content that highlights the Olympic venues and Pyongchang area.  AZero deployed the Liquid Galaxy at the Gangneung branch office (near Pyongchang, and also a host of several venues).

Now that the games are in full swing, KEPCO is bringing VIPs, government officials, and a global list of business contacts to their center, and is using the Liquid Galaxy as the central platform to present their accomplishments.

If you’re in Pyongchang-- why not take some time to see this incredible immersive platform?

End Point is looking forward to further cooperation with AZero in Korea, as well as our partners in Japan for the 2020 Olympic games that will be held in Tokyo.
