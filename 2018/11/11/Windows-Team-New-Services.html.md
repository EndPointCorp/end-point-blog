#### Summary ####
Technology replacement is usually frowned upon due to the high cost of replacing hardware and the difficulty of adapting to new technologies. However, at End Point, we provide best of breed solutions which can help you improve efficiency, avoid downtime, and allow your employees to operate without loss of services. Replacing legacy equipment typically rewards companies with tax write offs for deprecated equipment, thus allowing companies to leverage the savings and purchase new hardware.
