**Search engine optimization (SEO)** is critical to the success of your website, and therefore critical to the success of your business. A high Google ranking means more page views — and more conversions. Google rewards websites that are user-friendly and easy-to-navigate, with fresh content and frequent updates. At End Point, we design with SEO in mind from the beginning of the project to help you get the most value from your online presence.

These are the five main areas that we focus on to improve your ranking:

1. **Content Strategy** — You want to provide your users with quality content. We can provide a content strategy to help ensure that your site stays on target, with clear copy, focused messaging, and consistent branding. We’ll help you put together a site that gets visitors where they want to be — and you’ll reap the rewards with an increase in traffic to your site.

2. **Sitemap, Keywords, and Semantic Markup** — We dive into the nuts and bolts of your site to make sure that it can be crawled and indexed easily by Google. We produce a prioritized XML sitemap, relevant, long-tail keywords and metadata, descriptive page headings, titles, and URLs. Your site’s code will utilize HTML5 semantic markup to produce a well-structured, hierarchical document that will be easily read by web crawlers — and humans, too.

4. **Blogging and Social Media** — Keeping your website fresh with new links and content is critical for SEO success. Setting up a blog platform makes it easy to quickly generate new content that can draw more visitors to your site. We can also connect you with social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook to help carry your messages across the web.

5. **Analytics** — Google Analytics allows you to watch in real time how users are finding and interacting with your site. Figure out which pages perform the best, which are underperforming, identify trends in user behavior, and calibrate your site to help users get the most out of their experience.

6. **Mobile Support** — With just over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/" target="_blank">half</a> of all web traffic coming from mobile devices, it’s crucial to have a website that’s responsive on any device. Because of the ubiquity of mobile browsing, Google rewards sites that are mobile friendly. We optimize your site to ensure that pages load quickly and display on any laptop, tablet, or smartphone.

There’s no big secret to a strong SEO strategy. It’s all about having engaging, useful content that’s easy to find and navigate. End Point has the knowledge and resources to help your business grow by building you a site that’s clear and focused, and one that’s up to the latest web standards.
