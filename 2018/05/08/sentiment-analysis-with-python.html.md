I had a chance spending my weekend enhancing my knowledge by joining a local community meetup in Malaysia which is sponsored by Malaysian Global Innovation & Creativity Centre (MaGIC). The trainer was Mr Lee Boon Kong.

### Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook

We started by preparing our Jupyter Notebook setup which is running on Anaconda Python distribution. The installer is 500MB in size but pretty handy when we started using it. Anaconda comes with a graphical based installed which is called "Navigator" if the user wants to install some packages for work. However it is not always working when I tried it on different OS platform - so I have to use its command line based tool called as "conda". Conda works like Linux-based package management tool (for e.g: apt, dnf, yum, pacman) - so if I decided to install a package I would just run `conda install <package name>`.


### Summary

In overall I am quite satisfied with I learned during the session. It is good to have one day spent on a technical workshop like this in which we could be super focus on the content without any external distraction. Kudos to Mr Lee for his effort to teach us on Data Analysis with Python. Till we meet again, hopefully!
