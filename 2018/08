We recently had the pleasure of traveling to Lagos Nigeria with one of our portable Liquid Galaxy systems.  Google is premiering a new free Wifi service for the region called Google Station and as a part of that, they wanted to show off the incredible amount of data and content that is available via Google Street View and Google Earth.  

Google also showcased slimmer versions of some of their most popular apps specially tailored to use fewer resources (memory, bandwidth, etc.) including “YouTube Go” and  “Files Go”.  These apps work very well on less powerful cell phones.The Nigerian economy is growing rapidly.  Wireless comms, geo-centric data, and technology investment are essential to that growth.  The Liquid Galaxy showcases the best of Google’s data in this context.

We shipped the system along with one of our engineers to make sure everything went well.  We’re happy to report that the event went flawlessly.  With our browser-based content management application, we created presentations that showed off some of the spectacular imagery from within Lagos.  Many of the event attendees had never used streetview and were visibly wowed when seeing it on our system.

Liquid Galaxy was a big hit!  The high point of the event was when the Vice President of Nigeria, Yemi Osinbajo, attended the Liquid Galaxy and took in some of the Street View scenes.  Here are some photos:

This was a fun event for us.  We hope that Liquid Galaxy can be prominently featured at more Google events, where we can showcase Google Earth, Street View, and all the rich graphical and data layers on top of those content sets.  We anticipate many more events and unique deployments of the Liquid Galaxy system in Africa as the economies grow rapidly throughout the region.
