Are you thinking about starting a new website and using BigCommerce, Shopify, or WooCommerce? The software-as-a-service offerings on the market today can help you get a great-looking, low-cost ecommerce website up and running quickly, but you may need more help than you first expect.

In order to get the most out of your site, ecommerce consultants like us at End Point can guide you through setup, customize your site to fit your brand, manage all of your technical requirements, and help drive traffic to your site. This post is an overview of services we offer to clients looking for a SaaS solution.

### Select the Right Vendor

Working with an expert consultant can help you make the right choices from the start. Sometimes knowing the level of customization that your project requires can be a real challenge. End Point has experience with everything from out-of-the-box SaaS platforms to large-scale, custom software developments — we take time to understand your requirements and guide you to the perfect solution for your business.

### Custom Design

Most SaaS offerings include ready-to-use, beautiful design templates, but you’ll often find that they require some tweaking. We can customize your design so that it fits perfectly with the look and feel of your brand, without the time and expense of going through the design process from scratch.

### User Experience and Navigation

Working with an ecommerce consultant that has experience with user behavior, site navigation, and business workflows can help you develop the best way to organize your pages and products. End Point’s content architecture services can ensure that your users are finding what they’re looking for and getting where they’re going quickly and seamlessly.

### Customizing Your Store

Customizing your store to work with your specific needs, like shipping integrations, 3rd party apps, and APIs can be a challenge. End Point can help you research the solutions already in place, or build custom solutions for your site.

### Email Setup

End Point can help you set up your email on your desktop or in the cloud, and can help you configure and maintain all of your in-house email needs.

### DNS and Domain Names

End Point has DevOps experts who can make sure everything with your domain name and DNS changes is handled quickly and correctly during the setup or migration of your site from one provider to another.

### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

A solid search engine optimization strategy is critical to the success of your website, and therefore critical to the success of your business. A high Google ranking means more page views — and more conversions. At End Point, we design and build with SEO in mind from the start to help you get the most value from your online presence.

### Payments and Merchants

End Point has experience with many major merchant vendors. We can help you find the right merchant, be it PayPal, Stripe, Authorize.net, Braintree, etc. We can make sure that payments are set up, tested, and integrated into your business cash flow. We also have experience with PCI compliance and can help you step through an evaluation or mitigation process and get your system in tip-top shape.

### Project Management

Are you trying to wrangle a team of people? Your old vendor and your new one? Do you need help in managing the project? Our project managers are here to help you meet your business goals and get to the finish line on time and within budget.

### System Migrations

Working with an expert consultant can really help when you are moving from one system to another. We have customizable data export and import scripts and many automated tools to move your content to your new platform and can save you hours of moving products and pages by hand.

### Summary

Working with a consultant agency can really give your SaaS project the professional edge you’ll need to compete in today’s ecommerce market. We offer consulting packages to fit your budget and the depth of services that you need. Talk to us today about how we could help get your project off the ground.
