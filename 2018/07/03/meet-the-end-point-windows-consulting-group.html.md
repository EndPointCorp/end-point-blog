### Meet the End Point Windows Consulting Group

As the share of internet traffic passing through mobile devices hovers around 50%, it's easy to forget that a lot of computing still happens on desktops and laptops -- and perhaps even easier to forget that the great majority of those desktops and laptops are running Windows.

At End Point, we take pride in not only being a platform-agnostic organization, but also using open source technologies in real world business environments. (Our internal chat service, wiki, and many other libraries and tools we employ across our client base are all open source.) However, not everyone is interested in reinventing the wheel, and many companies are best served with Microsoft's tried-and-tested solutions. Windows Server, Active Directory, and Exchange all remain industry standards, and many of our clients encounter issues that involve Microsoft technologies exclusively.

With the acquisition of Series Digital in 2017 and the addition of **Dan Briones** and **William Yeack**, End Point has begun supporting Windows infrastructure in a new way. In 2018 we’ve recently added two new engineers to the mix, **Chris Hopkins** and **Charles Chang**, to form a full service Windows Consulting Team, all local to our Park Avenue New York City office. 

## Dan Briones

He also develops applications using the .NET framework and SQL Server database. Dan works with many of our local New York clients, focusing on their network and infrastructure.
