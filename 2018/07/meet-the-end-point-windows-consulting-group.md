As the share of internet traffic passing through mobile devices hovers around 50%, it’s easy to forget that a lot of computing still happens on desktops and laptops—​and perhaps even easier to forget that the majority of those desktops and laptops are running Microsoft Windows.

At End Point, we take pride in being a multi-platform organization and using open source technologies in real-world business environments. Our internal chat service, wiki, and many other libraries and tools we employ across our client base are all open source. However, for various reasons many companies choose Microsoft’s solutions including long-time standards Windows Server, Active Directory, and Exchange.

In April 2017, **Dan Briones** came to End Point to head up the company’s new Windows infrastructure services. In 2018 we added two new engineers to the mix, **Chris Hopkins** and **Charles Chang**, to form a full-service Windows consulting team, all local to our New York City office on Park Avenue.

### Dan Briones

Dan is the team lead and has over three decades of hands-on experience in IT systems management, systems integrations, migrations, virtualization, networking, security, orchestration, security, compliance, and maintenance, specializing in the Microsoft Windows ecosystem. He also develops applications using the .NET framework and SQL Server database. Dan works with many of our local New York clients, focusing on their network and infrastructure.
