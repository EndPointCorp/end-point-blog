<p>I worked with them to help launch a new website with a design from <a href="http://ensoblue.com/">Enso Blue</a>, which brings us to the point of the article. Given a choice of many platforms and tools, what tools did I use in development of a new site with the only restriction being how much time I was able to put into development and maintenance? Here's a quick rundown the tools I used for the new website.</p>

   <p style="margin:0px;"><a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>: Here at End Point, we develop many applications in Ruby and Ruby on Rails. It's a platform that encourages decent code organization and efficient development. Another option that came up was PHP with WordPress. However, since the website required a custom application and voting process for joining members, I concluded that WordPress would be a bit of a hassle with this level of customization (though I'm personally a big fan of WordPress and its community).</p>

  <td valign="top">
   <p style="margin:0px;"><a href="https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin">RailsAdmin</a>: I blog about RailsAdmin a lot because it's become my go-to tool for providing a thorough admin interface that integrates nicely with <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">Devise</a> (user authentication) and <a href="https://github.com/ryanb/cancan">CanCan</a> (user authorization).

  <td valign="top">
   <p style="margin:0px;"><a href="https://github.com/stephskardal/rails_admin_import">RailsAdminImport</a>. This is  an open source Ruby on Rails gem that I developed for an End Point client to import data, because RailsAdmin doesn't include import functionality out of the box. By installing this gem into the HeARTs Speak application, I introduced the ability to import data from CSV easily. Read more about it <a href="/blog/2012/02/01/railsadmin-import-part-2">here</a>.</p>
  </td>
  <td style="background:#DDE4DF;" valign="top">
   <p style="margin:0px;"><a href="http://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a>. I installed New Relic's free offering's for both Rails application monitoring and server monitoring. New Relic is a very popular performance analytics and monitoring tool in the Rails space. They offer paid membership levels as well, but I am satisfied with the free basic monitoring at this point.</p>

  <td style="background:#DDE4DF;" valign="top">
   <p style="margin:0px;"><b>Full Page Caching</b>. Known Rails pitfalls include poor performance and a demanding server load. I added full page caching to all front-end facing pages to mitigate the effects of poor performance. I recently wrote about page caching in RailsAdmin <a href="/blog/2012/03/16/cache-expiration-railsadmin">here</a>.</p>
  </td>
  <td valign="top">
   <p style="margin:0px;"><a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>. This is an obvious and popular choice. Google Analytics offers so much in the way of traffic analysis, conversion analytics, and now even real-time tracking. If you aren't using it on your site, you should be!</p>

  <td valign="top">
   <p style="margin:0px;"><b>UI Elements</b>. The HeARTs Speak website includes several user interface elements such as the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/">Google Maps API</a>, <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/web/">Facebook integration</a>, and the popular jQuery plugin <a href="http://nivo.dev7studios.com/">Nivo Slider</a>.</p>

  <td style="background:#DDE4DF;" valign="top">
   <p style="margin:0px;"><b>Apache Performance Configuration</b>. My server was already configured to include <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html">best practice performance tweaks</a>, also described by Jon <a href="/blog/2009/10/23/performance-optimization-of">here</a> and <a href="/blog/2010/11/02/speeding-up-spree-demo-site">here</a>.</p>

   <p style="margin:0px;"><a href="http://www.webpagetest.org">WebPageTest</a>. This is a nice service for examining performance of a website. Several of us End Pointers have mentioned it in blog articles before. If you aren't using a performance analysis tool like <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/">WebPageTest</a> or <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/">YSlow</a>, I'd highly recommend it.</p>

   <p style="margin:0px;"><a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> and <a href="http://www.screencast-o-matic.com/">Screencast-O-Matic</a>. Firebug is always a huge part of development for me. In this project, I used Screencast-O-Matic to provide an example of what it's like to work with Firebug to speed up the design iteration process, similar to process described <a href="/blog/2012/03/19/video-firebug-action">in this blog article</a>.</p>
