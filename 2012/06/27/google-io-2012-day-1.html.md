title: Google I/O 2012, Day 1
---

I'm here in San Francisco at Google I/O 2012 with coworkers Kiel, Matt, and Ben.

Today began with Sergey Brin giving a really great keynote speech introducing a ton of new Google products and features, including Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, Google's new Nexus 7" tablet, the Nexus Q, and the addition of magazines and TV to the Google Play Store. Not to mention Google Glass, still under heavy development.

Back in the "sandbox" demo area, we've been showing attendees this cool prototype cockpit Liquid Galaxy. A cool new feature introduced with this Google Earth build is helicopter imagery, which is a 3D building layer created by taking photos of the landscape from different angles. I have some pictures for you.

Google I/O attendees looking at the Galaxy:

Setting up beforehand:

As it turned out, this isn't the Liquid Galaxy that was intended for Google I/O. The newest cockpit frame was supposed to arrive some days ago, and was only found this morning. Hopefully we'll be able to set it up tonight to have a better Liquid Galaxy experience for the next few days!
