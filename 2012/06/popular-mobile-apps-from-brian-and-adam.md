In our last lightning talk of the conference, Brian Dillon and [Adam Vollrath](/blog/authors/adam-vollrath) shared some of their favorite mobile apps. Brian queried the room to see the phone type divide in the room. Here was our split: 33%—​iPhones, 33%—​Androids, 33%—​unsmart phones.

Brian likes pure simplicity for iPhone apps:

- [Dropkick](https://web.archive.org/web/20120804061041/http://dropkickapp.com/), categorization, syncing, require account creation
- [Simplenote](https://web.archive.org/web/20120731035429/http://www.simplenoteapp.com/): same thing, but for notes

Adam has an Android “because Google owns him”:

- [Google Goggles](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/166331): Rumored Google technology is integrated into this. Google tries to ad-hoc identify logos, book covers, automatic translation of images, images, QR codes.
- [K9 Mail](https://k9mail.github.io/): email client
- [Andchat](https://web.archive.org/web/20120730123717/http://www.andchat.net/): IRC client
- [WiFi Analyzer](https://web.archive.org/web/20120826070800/http://www.flukenetworks.com/enterprise-network/wireless-network/AirMagnet-WiFi-Analyzer): provides site survey on network traffic
