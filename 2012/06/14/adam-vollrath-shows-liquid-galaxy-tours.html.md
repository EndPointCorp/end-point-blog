No one has presented more Liquid Galaxy Tours than Adam Vollrath.

Silver Spring Networks has made extensive use of Liquid Galaxy tours to demonstrate the capabilities of their smart grid technology. Adam most recently presented some of this work at the EMC 2012 in Las Vegas. The tours visualize data on such things as peak power usage time and place, outages and repair times, even lightning strikes.

This data can bore down to individual meters per residence or business. Graphic representation of this data is overlaid on Google Earth. This creates stunning visualizations of Silver Spring Networksâ€™ capabilities.

There are applications for high-end real estate as well. After a trip to the property with a panoramic camera, a property can be toured virtually. End Point is actively developing this capability. Early demonstrations have taken us to Grand Central Station, an Occupy rally, and Highline Park in Manhattan.

Not featured in this talk is a large library of tours created for Google Ocean. These tours have been seen at conferences around the world.
