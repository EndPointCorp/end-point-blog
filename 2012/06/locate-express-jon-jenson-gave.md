Jon Jensen gave a presentation about our client Locate Express, which is a locator service website that allows the user to instantaneously locate a professional in a specific area. The site was launched in 2011 and has been picking up in popularity ever since.

You can “Find a Pro”, as they put it, in three easy steps:

- Step 1, you select the service you are looking for. You can select anything from lawn care to plumbing.
- Step 2, you enter the address location you would like to locate the closest “pros” for the specified service.
- Step 3 shows you a list of pros for the selected service on a map. You can then select the pro of your choosing.

This is a very useful and easy to use service. I think Locate Express has great potential to catch on as it continues to gain traction, especially for service providers carrying “smart” mobile devices. In particular I think this will become more popular in utility emergencies on the weekends and after-hours, when it might be more difficult to find someone to fix your broken water pipe.
