Our company meeting at End Point opened today with a presentation about one of our clients, [College District](http://www.collegedistrict.com/) by Terry Grant and [Ron Phipps](/team/ron-phipps/), explaining how the site works from a mostly technical angle. College District is a “community where fans and designers create, grade, and promote collegiate products you can’t find anywhere else.” Each team has its own site: for example, the University of Florida Gators can be found at [GatorDistrict.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20120211103614/http://www.gatordistrict.com/).

Ron and Terry explained the history of how College District moved from a brick and mortar store to their current wide array of sites. They also explained all the technical underpinnings of how things work behind the scene. The sites are powered by [Interchange](http://www.icdevgroup.org/i/dev), [Postgres 9.1](https://www.postgresql.org/), [Git](https://git-scm.com), and other cool technologies. They also explored some of the exciting upcoming ideas for the site, including ...no, [that would be telling](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Prisoner).
