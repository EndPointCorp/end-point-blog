I know Richard best from his sysadmin work on End Point’s Hosting Team. But I also worked with him for our client Paper Source, covered by his presentation at our company meeting today.

Paper Source began in Chicago back in 1983. Since then they’ve opened more brick and mortar stores every year, now up to 54. End Point is now maintaining their e-commerce store, which supplements these well.

Richard and his team have integrated Interchange with many other software packages, including Adobe’s Scene7, Authorize.net, Great Plains, Endeca, and CoreMetrics. This adds up to many scheduled cron jobs every night. We also handle hosting of the production and Camps development servers.
