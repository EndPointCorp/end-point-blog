A few weekends ago I gave a talk at Ohio LinuxFest: [Yes, You Can Run Your Business On PostgreSQL. Next Question?](http://joshwilliams.name/postgres_in_the_enterprise/) (slides freshly posted.)  The talk isn't as technically oriented as the ones I'll usually give, but rather more inspirational and encouraging.  It seemed like a good and reasonable topic, centered around Postgres but applicable to open source in general, and it's something I'd been wanting to get out there for a while.

In a previous life I worked with Microsoft shops a bit more often.  You know, companies that use Windows and related software pretty much exclusively.  This talk was, more or less, a result of a number of conversations with those companies about open source software and why it's a valid option.  I heard a number of arguments against, some reasonable, some pretty far out there, so it felt like it'd be a good thing to gather up all of those that I'd heard over time.

These days I don't interact with those companies so much, so I was a little worried at first that the landscape had changed enough that the talk wouldn't really be useful any more.  But after talking with a few people around the conference a day or two before the talk, there's definitely some companies that don't see the value in open source technologies.

The slides are essentially a rough outline, but I tried to go back and add some of the spoken context.  Anyway, enjoy, and hopefully it'll help you get the open source word out.
