I was asked to give on both day one and day two a talk called “Website Performance Boot Camp” which carried this brief description:

Here is the video recording of the first time I presented the talk. (The technician noted its audio was “a little hot”.)

Thanks again to the conference organizers and the other speakers and sponsors, and the nice venue [Utah Valley University](http://www.uvu.edu/), for making it a great conference!
