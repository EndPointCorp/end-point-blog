It’s been two weeks now since the [Utah Open Source Conference](https://web.archive.org/web/20120525040559/http://conference.utos.org/) for 2012. My fellow End Pointers wrote previously about it: Josh Ausborne about the [mini Liquid Galaxy](/blog/2012/05/end-point-at-utah-open-source/) we set up there for everyone to play with, and Josh Tolley with a [write-up of his talks](/blog/2012/05/utosc-recap/) on database constraints and KML for geographic mapping markup.

There were a lot of interesting talks planned, and I could only attend some of them. I really enjoyed these:

- Rob Taylor on [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)

- Brandon Johnson on Red Hat’s virtualization with [oVirt](https://www.ovirt.org/), [Spacewalk](https://spacewalkproject.github.io/), [Katello](https://theforeman.org/plugins/katello/), and [Aeolus](https://web.archive.org/web/20120519125110/http://www.aeolusproject.org/)

- Clint Savage about RPM packaging with [Mock](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock/wiki) & [Koji](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Koji)

- Daniel Evans on testing web applications with [Capybara](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara), embedded WebKit, and Selenium (which End Pointer Mike Farmer [wrote about here](/blog/2011/12/running-integration-tests-in-webkit/) back in December)

- Aaron Toponce on [breaking full-disk encryption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGOoLGZB2Ps) (I missed this talk, but learned about it from Aaron in the hallway track and his slides afterwards)

- Matt Harrison’s tutorial [Hands-on intermediate Python](https://web.archive.org/web/20120508201627/http://hairysun.com/blog/2012/05/04/utah-open-source-conference-python-tutorial-materials/), covering doctest, function parameters and introspection, closures, function and class decorators, and more.

I gave a talk on GNU Screen vs. tmux, which was fun (and ends with a live demo that predictably fell apart, and audience questions that you can’t hear on the recording). Here’s the video:

I have a bit more to cover from the conference later!
