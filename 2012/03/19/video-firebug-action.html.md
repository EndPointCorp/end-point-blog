title: 'Firebug in Action: CSS Changes'
---



When I work with clients, I encourage them to use tools to improve efficiency for web development. Sometimes my clients want styling (CSS) adjustments like font-size, padding, or orientation changes, but they aren't sure what they want before they've seen it applied to real content. I recommend embracing a tool such as [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/) for examining temporary on-page CSS edits. Here's a quick video that demonstrates Firebug in action as I try out a few adjustments to End Point's home page.

Some of the changes I test out in the video include:

- Font-color changes
- Deleting DOM elements
- Padding, margin adjustments
- Background color changes

Firebug offers a lot more functionality but the video covers interactive CSS changes only. Read more about Firebug's features [here](http://getfirebug.com/). Chrome has similar functionality with the Developer Tools included in the core software. There are similar tools in the other browsers, but I develop in Chrome or Firefox and I'm not familiar with them.
