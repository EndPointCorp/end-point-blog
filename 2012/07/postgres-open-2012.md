I’m excited to be speaking at the 2012 Postgres Open Conference; Chicago, September 17-19. (Conference details at [http://www.postgresopen.org/](https://web.archive.org/web/20130517131230/http://postgresopen.org:80/2012/home/).)

My talk will be “Choosing a Logical Replication System: Slony vs Bucardo”.

I look forward to seeing many of you there!
