We had a “virtual” company meeting today using [Big Blue Button](https://www.bigbluebutton.org/) with [Free Conference Call HD](https://www.freeconferencecallhd.com/) for audio. I gave an overview on the upcoming crop of JavaScript MVC Frameworks and how they attempt to mitigate some of the issues faced by JavaScript-heavy web applications. Later on, I spoke more specifically about [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) and [Ember](https://emberjs.com/) and demonstrated an example Todo List application from [Addy Osmani](https://addyosmani.com/blog/)’s [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) project. If you are interested in evaluating and learning more about client-side frameworks, TodoMVC is definitely worth a look.

### Slides from the talk

I used Google Presentations (now [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about/)) for this as I have for several other talks lately and have found it really great to use and collaborate on presentations with others. Check out the slide deck from my talk below:

### Q&A

During the Q&A time afterward we discussed [LocalStorage](http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html) a little bit as it’s used for the storage layer for each of the TodoMVC todo list applications. We covered some of the options which allow client-side MVC frameworks to sync data between the client and RESTful server-side web services.

We also covered how much the [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/) have improved recently and I encouraged my colleagues to try them out if they haven’t already done so. Many End Pointers including myself use [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/) and we talked a little about where it excels compared to the Chrome Dev Tools. Logging and inspecting XHR requests was a great feature Steph pointed out.

It’s great to have some many helpful tools and software like this to work with in the open source community.
