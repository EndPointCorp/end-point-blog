**(This position has been filled.)**

We are seeking a full-time PostgreSQL database administrator and developer to support and consult with our clients. For this role we prefer those living in the Western Hemisphere.

End Point is an Internet technology consulting company based in New York City, with 50 employees serving many clients ranging from small family businesses to large corporations. The company turned 25 years old this year!

Even before the pandemic most of us worked remotely from home offices. We collaborate using SSH, Git, project tracking tools, Zulip chat, video conferencing, and of course email and phones.

### What you bring:

5+ years of hands-on professional experience and technical expertise with:

- Database design and systems architecture
- Advanced SQL and query optimization
- Programming for web applications, stored procedures, and scripting, in Ruby, Java, Python, PHP, Perl, JavaScript, C#, Go, PL/pgSQL, bash, etc.
- Performance tuning, scalability, connection pooling
- Cloud database hosting services, especially at AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure
- Security and encryption
- Replication, PITR, backup, monitoring, and relevant tools
- HA, failover, and disaster recovery
- Database upgrades and migrations
- Programming language interfaces to the database
- Linux system administration and observation
- DevOps and “configuration as code”
- Troubleshooting problems and handling emergencies
- Other databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, Oracle, SQL Server, Redis, Solr, Elasticsearch, etc.
- Git version control
- Bonus for familiarity with running PostgreSQL on Windows, and with the Bucardo replication system

These work traits are just as important:

- Strong verbal and written communication skills
- An eye for detail
- Tenacity in solving problems and focusing on customer needs
- A feeling of ownership of your projects
- Work both independently and as part of a team
- Ability to pass a criminal background check or get a security clearance when clients require
- A good remote work environment

### What work here offers:

- Collaborate with knowledgeable, friendly, helpful, and diligent co-workers around the world
- Flexible, sane work hours
- Paid holidays and vacation
- Annual bonus opportunity
- For U.S. employees: health insurance subsidy and 401(k) retirement savings plan
- Freedom from being tied to an office location
- Use your desktop OS of choice: Linux, macOS, Windows
- Use open source tools and contribute back as opportunity arises

### Get in touch with us:

Please email us an introduction to [jobs@endpoint.com](mailto:jobs@endpoint.com) to apply. Include your location, a resume/​CV, your Git repository or LinkedIn URLs, and whatever else may help us get to know you.
