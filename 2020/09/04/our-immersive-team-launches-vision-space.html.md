End Point Corporation’s immersive technology team has launched [Vision.Space](https://vision.space/). Evolved from End Point’s Liquid Galaxy, Vision.Space lets users control touchscreens, video walls, shared laptops, and WiFi controllers, all with a swipe of a finger.

Vision.Space was created to incorporate any number of displays in a video wall configuration. Each display is maximized for resolution and shows a geometrically-adjusted viewing angle to avoid the fish-eye distortion commonly seen on conventional video walls. The platform also incorporates touchscreens placed around the room, enabling participants multiple input sources to manipulate and interact with the visualizations presented.

A “meeting director” can incorporate and guide multiple inbound video streams via an intuitive interface on an iPad or tablet controller. Directing someone’s laptop image to any screen in the room is as easy as swiping a video thumbnail into the appropriate square on the tablet.

Our new Vision.Space platform combines custom server hardware with commercial displays and touchscreens, and is an ideal cutting-edge conference room system for enterprise-level companies in commercial real estate, logistics, and travel, among other industries. Central to Vision.Space is End Point’s CMS (Content Management System), which enables clients to quickly and easily build multimedia presentations for the platform.

Vision.Space’s system architecture is based in Linux and ROS (Robot Operating System), and provides a fundamentally secure, stable, and flexible environment for companies seeking to display extensive geospatial data sets in a concise and interactive manner. Research universities, multimedia studios, and data laboratories are also well-positioned to fully leverage Vision.Space, as it allows for multiple data sources and visualization streams to be viewed simultaneously. Museums, aquariums, and science centers can utilize Vision.Space to wow their visitors by combining immersive video with interactive displays that surround the guests in a data-immersive environment.

Vision.Space is a huge step forward in End Point’s mission to create the ideal platform for shared immersive presentations, and our team put in a great effort to bring this to life. We are proud to announce that Vision.Space is ready for deployment. For more information, contact [sales@vision.space](mailto:sales@vision.space) or visit [vision.space](https://vision.space).
