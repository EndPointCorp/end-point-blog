We are looking for a PHP software engineer to work with us during business hours somewhere in the UTC-7 to UTC-4 time zones (U.S. Pacific to Eastern Time). This role can be full-time or part-time.

We are an Internet technology consulting company based in New York City, with 50 employees serving many clients ranging from small family businesses to large corporations. The company turns 25 years old this year!  

Even before COVID-19 most of us worked remotely from home offices. We collaborate using SSH, GitHub, GitLab, chat, video conferencing, and of course email and phones.

### What you will be doing:

- Develop new web applications and support existing ones for our clients
- Work together with End Point co-workers and our clients’ in-house staff 
- Use your desktop OS of choice: Linux, macOS, Windows
- Use open source tools and contribute back as opportunity arises

### What you bring:

Professional experience developing and supporting web applications in these technical areas:

- 5+ years of development with PHP and front-end JavaScript
- Frameworks such as Symfony, Laravel, Magento and Vue.js, React, Angular
- Databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Solr, Elasticsearch, etc.
- Security consciousness
- Git version control
- Automated testing
- HTTP, REST APIs
- Bonus for familiarity with another ecosystem such as Ruby on Rails, Python/​Django, Java, .NET/​C#, Node.js, Go, Rust, Scala, Kotlin, Swift …

These work traits are just as important:

- Strong verbal and written communication skills
- An eye for detail
- Tenacity in solving problems
- A feeling of ownership of your projects
- Work both independently and as part of a team
- Focus on customer needs
- A good remote work environment

### What work here offers:

- Collaborate with knowledgeable, friendly, helpful, and diligent co-workers around the world
- Flexible, sane work hours
- Annual bonus opportunity
- Freedom from being tied to an office location
- For full-time staff: paid holidays and vacation
- For U.S. employees: health insurance subsidy and 401(k) retirement savings plan

### Get in touch with us:

~~Please email us an introduction to jobs&#x40;endpoint.com to apply.~~
**(This job has been filled.)**
Include your location, a resume/​CV, your GitHub or LinkedIn URLs, and whatever else helps us get to know you.
