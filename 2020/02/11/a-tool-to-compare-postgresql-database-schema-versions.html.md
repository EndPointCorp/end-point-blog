The End Point development team has completed a major data-intensive application migration from one tech stack to another. Many years ago, the vendor maintaining the old stack abandoned support and development. This led to a stack evolution riddled with independent custom changes and new features in the following years. The new application was developed by a consortium that allowed migration scripts to transfer data to a fresh stack resulting in a completely restructured database schema. While consortium migration scripts cannot be directly applied to our client application, attempting to create migration scripts from scratch would be tedious due to more labor-intensive and time-consuming tasks. Our development team looked to reuse and customize the scripts in order to ensure an exact match of the customized changes to the client’s application.


### Liquibase - Schema Comparison Tool

After an arduous hunt to acquire a suitable solution, the End Point team came across Liquibase - an open-source schema comparison tool that utilizes the diff command to assess line items such as missing, changed, and unexpected objects.

### Installation and Usage

Below is an example of how to use Liquibase as well as review the insights and results offered by the diff command. Before beginning, download the latest version of [liquibase tarball](https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase/releases/) format binary package from GitHub and extract the installation path. As the default package doesn't have it’s own driver, it would be wise to add the PostgreSQL driver to the lib folder (this can also be used for other databases with necessary libraries and drivers).


```bash

$ wget https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase/releases/download/v3.8.5/liquibase-3.8.5.tar.gz
$ tar -xvzf liquibase-3.8.5.tar.gz
$ wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/postgresql/postgresql/42.2.5/postgresql-42.2.5.jar -P lib/

$ ./liquibase \
--classpath="/Users/<user>/apps/liquidiff/lib" \
--outputFile=liquibase_output.txt \
--driver=org.postgresql.Driver \
--url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/schema_two \
--username=postgres \
--password=CHANGEME \
--defaultSchemaName=public \
Diff \
--referenceUrl=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/schema_one \
--referenceUsername=postgres \
--referencePassword=CHANGEME \
--referenceDefaultSchemaName=public

```

### Comparison Results
The following output shows the list of all sections with missing, changed, and newly added objects to each section.

```bash
$ cat liquibase_output.txt

### Conclusion
Although comparing and contrasting the 100+ tables from the old application was beneficial, the data migration aspect of the undertaking was challenging due to volume and variety of data. However, with the help of Liquibase, we became more familiarized with differences in the schema (including table level, columns, references, indexes, views, .etc). With this leading to an increase in accuracy, we found the software to be very helpful during the migration process. The End Point development team hopes that by sharing its findings, others will also benefit from this tool and all that it offers.
