![The usual suspects of my working setups; Macbook, Magic Mouse, iPad and a mug of coffee.](/blog/2023/04/ipad-as-a-second-display-for-macbook/mysetup.webp)
If you are hooked with your external monitor at your home or workstation, you will feel like missing a body part when you have to do your work outside, without it. Luckily we can control our iPad from our Macbook to make it as if it was a second display for our Macbook. Although not as good as a real monitor or as big as our beloved external monitor at home, the iPad as a second display has its own advantages.

### The Advantages
Ipad as a second display for Macbook works out of the box without the need of installing any additional software. All we need to do is to configure the communication between the two devices as we will go through in the coming section. Another great thing about this setup is it is wireless. This is really light and compact for outside work. This setup could easily fit on any table at any coffee shop. 

### The Caveat
Please take note that we are not making an iPad as our external monitor. What we are doing here is to enable our Macbook keyboard and mouse to access the iPad and making it a second display for us. This ability is known as Universal Control. By doing this you could do any work at your Macbook and switch to another work at iPad by dragging the mouse cursor to iPad.  

### The requirement
Ensure both devices are login with the same apple id
Ensure both devices are using the same wifi and the bluetooth is enable
Macbook 2016 or later and iPad is 6th Generation ( Reference: https://support.apple.com/en-my/guide/ipad/aside/ipad8ee99438/16.0/ipados/16.0)


### The Steps


#### Steps at Macbook

1. Click Apple logo   > System Settings..
2. Click Display > Advanced
3. Click the following slider to activate them

#### Steps at iPad
1. Go to setting
2. Click General > Click AirPlay & Handoff
3. Click the following slider to activate them 
    
#### The final step
Drag the mouse cursor to the edge of the monitor which is near to the iPad.  Wait for a few seconds and the cursor  will get to the edge of the iPad screen. Drag it even more into the iPad and we can control the iPad from our Macbook keyboard and mouse.

### To disable what we have done
Just undo what we have done in **The Steps** section

### Conclusion
That is all folks. I hope you enjoyed this portable , wireless and freely available second display( assuming you already have an iPad). Have a nice day.
