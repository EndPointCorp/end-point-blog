If you are hooked with your external monitor at your home or workstation, you will feel like missing a body part when you have to do your work outside, without it. Luckily we can control our iPad from our Macbook to make it as if it was a second display for our Macbook. Although not as good as a real monitor or as big as our beloved external monitor at home, the iPad as a second display has its own advantages.

### The Advantages
Ipad as a second display for Macbook works out of the box without the need of installing any additional software. All we need to do is to configure the communication between the two devices as we will go through in the coming section. Another great thing about this setup is it is wireless. This is really light and compact for outside work. This setup could easily fit on any table at any coffee shop.


### The Requirement
