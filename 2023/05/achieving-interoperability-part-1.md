### About the Achieving Interoperability Article Series

This article is the first in a three part series covering the complex and pressing challenges involved with achieving healthcare data interoperability, along with some promising solutions emerging within the public health industry. Each part in the series is listed below:

* Part I: Pandora’s Box and the Problem of Healthcare Data Standardization
* [Part II: Combating the Curse: Interoperability’s Quest for a Solution]()
* [Part III: A New Hope: CasePointer’s Unique Standardization Approach]()

This series aims to raise awareness of the modern technological problems that must be overcome to achieve interoperability in the United States, understand the strengths and weaknesses of the traditional standardization strategy, and learn how the CasePointer Workflow by End Point is taking a fresh approach to solving this issue for public health jurisdictions across the nation.

### Parallels with Pandora

If you Google “pandora’s box”, you’re likely to find something like this:

> Pandora's box is an artifact in Greek mythology connected with the myth of Pandora in Hesiod's c. 700 B.C. poem Works and Days. Hesiod related that curiosity led her to open a container left in the care of her husband, thus releasing curses upon mankind.

If you just did that (instead of pulling up an app with a similar name to listen to some music on your phone), you may be asking, “What in the world does this mythological story have to do with healthcare data standardization?” A closer look finds the parallel. Pandora was given a box and told not to open it, but her curiosity got the best of her, and she ended up letting loose a myriad of problematic curses onto the world when she looked inside. Healthcare data standardization is a bit like that. 

Back in the 1970’s, people were curious about healthcare technology, and what they could do if it became digitally accessible across a variety of different health systems. By the end of the 1980’s, a non-profit organization known as Health Level Seven International had released several data standards, such as [HL7 v2.5.1](https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=144), which is still widely used today. Although these standards allowed healthcare systems to communicate in ways never before possible, no one ever agreed on a single authoritative data standard–and things got complicated–which led to more problems.

### Entangled Technology

Since the 1980’s healthcare providers, software developers, and public health investigators have been hard at work trying to figure out the best standards and methods for interconnecting the vast and ever-expanding recesses of patient data. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ([HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/consumers/privacy-security-electronic-records.pdf)), much of this data must be kept secure and protected at all times, so that it will not be accessed without patient consent. New healthcare data standards have also emerged, such as [HL7 v3](https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_section.cfm?section=14), the Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture ([C-CDA](https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=492)), the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource ([FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=491)) and more. Since the adoption and implementation of these standards is incentivized, and not mandated by the United States government, all of these standards now exist in some capacity. This means they must all somehow interact with one another as patient data travels from system to system. Our best efforts thus far have entangled us in even greater complexity.

### Chaotic Conventions

As if working with multiple standards and security imperatives like HIPAA was not stressful enough, another factor which healthcare professionals must navigate is accurately understanding and interpreting the diverse conventions used by those reporting the data. As a patient's health record accumulates data over time, not all data sources utilize the same local conventions for things like facility names and lab codes. For example, a convention like “KUMED” or “KU MAIN” may be recognized in nearby communities, or states as the main campus of the [University of Kansas Medical Center](https://www.kumc.edu/) at 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS 66160. Using local conventions like this presents some problems, as not every provider throughout the United States may recognize them or misinterpret this data if similar to another facility in their area. The University of Kansas Health System consists of a [large network of satellite facilities](https://www.kansashealthsystem.com/locations) that span across the states of Kansas and Missouri, rather than just one location in a single state. This may create additional confusion in the public health realm as to which state jurisdictions should be involved.

### The Data Dilemma

These compound issues have prompted decades of discussion within the healthcare industry regarding the best solution to achieve true data interoperability among such diverse systems. An article published in December 2022 by Dr. Naheed Ali identifies, “Inconsistent data and lack of standardized data structure” as the number one issue to be overcome regarding the Electronic Health Record ([EHR](https://www.healthit.gov/faq/what-electronic-health-record-ehr)) interoperability challenges facing [healthcare] professions today.” Dr. Ali goes on to say, “One of the biggest EHR interoperability challenges in healthcare interoperability is managing inconsistent data from multiple sources. Information stored in different databases can have a variety of formats and data types that are not easily compatible with one another. A single record may contain different information about a patient's medical history or treatment plan, making it more difficult for different systems to interpret correctly” Dr. Ali’s full article is linked here for reference, titled: [EHR Interoperability Challenges and Solutions](https://www.ehrinpractice.com/ehr-interoperability-challenges-solutions.html).

### Interoperability and Pandora’s Hope

In the story of Pandora’s Box, after the box is opened and the curses inside unintentionally released, hope remains trapped inside. With regard to all the unintended complexities produced by efforts to standardize healthcare data, the “hope” of the industry lies with interoperability. A quick internet search returns a myriad of definitions for interoperability as it applies to various settings. To be clear: within the context of this series, interoperability refers to the ability of diverse software systems in healthcare and public health to communicate effectively with one another.

**Interoperability refers to the ability of diverse software systems in healthcare and public health to communicate effectively with one another.**

Although great strides have been made to digitize healthcare data and improve interoperability, much remains to be done to streamline the multiple formats, spread out across numerous EHR platforms in various data standards. Newer standards (like HL7 FHIR released in 2014) face an uphill battle for industry adoption to become as widely utilized as HL7 v2 (from 1989) and C-CDA (from 2011). The next part of this series explores the most common approaches to achieving interoperability in use today.

### Fighting for a Healthier Future

In summary, awareness of the technological problems to be overcome is key to achieving interoperability within the United States. Since the 1970s, healthcare providers, software developers, and public health officials have been diligently pursuing solutions. Their valiant efforts unfortunately led to an extremely complex system with multiple standards in circulation. Pandora must have felt overwhelmed by the consequences of opening the box, and healthcare professionals have no doubt felt the same. Although this parallels the problem in the ancient myth, one difference sets their story apart: Where Pandora’s curiosity was self-focused and led to a catastrophe without hope, the dedicated people behind every healthcare standard are others-focused, and earnestly fighting for a healthier future for all of us. With the power to map all local conventions into a single standard, and the flexibility of its integrated applications vs. other solutions, CasePointer by End Point is the hope in Pandora’s box.
