End Point is proud to have been an exhibitor at the 2023 CSTE conference in Salt Lake City, Utah. 

We are grateful to have had the opportunity to showcase our latest offering, CasePointer, to state and territorial epidemiologists as well as hear about all of the latest research in the fields of informatics and disease surveillance.

The conference served as a meeting place to discuss the future of data management on state and national levels, with many talks exploring the technologies that will become future standards and practices.

The End Point booth was abuzz with visitors getting hands-on demos using the EpiTrax software as well as learning about the other aspects of the CasePointer suite, such as the Electronic Message Staging Area (EMSA), our new disease reporting portal, and the EpiTrax NMI module.

The CasePointer demo highlighted its capability of streamlining the management of epidemiological data with a user-friendly and highly customizable interface. 

The CSTE conference provides a valuable opportunity to engage with epidemiologists and gain insights into the daily obstacles they encounter in data reception, management, and sharing. It offers a platform to learn about their strategies for overcoming these challenges within their respective jurisdictions.

One of the common topics that came up was tackling the challenge of file transfers using current protocols and systems in place. We were happy to share our successes using EMSA to customize how data is received and uploaded to EpiTrax, making transfers faster, more reliable, and easier to manage.

We look forward to further conversations with the visitors that stopped by our booth, and hope that you enjoyed the locally crafted chocolates and caramels and saved some for the trip home!
