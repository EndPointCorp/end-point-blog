### How to Set Up pgTap for Testing Database Functions in EpiTrax

#### Introduction
In a previous blog post by Josh Tolley, he introduced the concept of using pgTap, a set of PostgreSQL functions designed for writing unit tests within the database. This post will serve as a supplement to Josh's blog, focusing on setting up pgTap for testing database functions.

#### How we use pgTap in EpiTrax for testing database functions
EpiTrax relies on PostgreSQL and its functions, making pgTap an ideal tool for testing the platform's database functions, ensuring data integrity, and maintaining the robustness of the system. By utilizing pgTap, EpiTrax can efficiently validate various aspects of its database structure and behavior.

#### Installing & setting up pgTap
**Note**: make sure you have PostgreSQL installed on your system. If you don't have it, you can follow postgres documentation to learn how to install it.

To install pgtap for PostgreSQL, you will need to follow these steps:

1.download the pgtap source code from its GitHub repository

```
git clone https://github.com/pgtap/pgtap.git
```
2. Navigate to the pgtap directory

```
cd pgtap
```

4. Install the required dependencies for pgtap
```
make && make install
```
6. Install the required dependencies for pgtap
```
make && make install
```
8. Finally, connect to your PostgreSQL database using psql or any other PostgreSQL client and run the following SQL command to create the pgtap extension:
```
CREATE EXTENSION pgtap;
```

Now you should have pgtap installed and ready to use in your PostgreSQL database. In case you face issues with Installation visit pgtap documentation for further help.

####  Writing Simple Database tests with pgTap:
Test to check if a table exists:
```
SELECT plan(1);
SELECT has_table('public', 'your_table', 'Table your_table should exist');
SELECT finish();
```

Test to check if a column exists in a table:
```
SELECT plan(1);
SELECT has_column('public', 'your_table', 'your_column', 'Column your_column should exist in your_table');
SELECT finish();
```

Test to check if a function returns the expected result:
```
SELECT plan(1);
SELECT is(your_function(), expected_result, 'your_function() should return expected_result');
SELECT finish();
```

Test to check if a trigger is triggered:
```
SELECT plan(1);
SELECT has_trigger('public', 'your_table', 'your_trigger', 'Trigger your_trigger should exist on your_table');
SELECT finish();
```

Test to check if a constraint is enforced:
```
SELECT plan(1);
SELECT has_fk('public', 'your_table', 'referenced_table', 'your_column', 'Constraint should exist between your_table and referenced_table');
SELECT finish();
```

#### Organizing and Naming your test files based on Test Anything Protocol (TAP)

Test Anything Protocol (TAP) is a convention for naming test files and organizing them within a project directory structure. The naming convention involves adding a numeric prefix to the test file name to indicate the order in which the tests should be run. For example, 00-test.sql is the first test file to be executed, followed by 01-another-test.sql, and so on.

The project directory structure usually includes a directory called t (short for "test") under the project root directory. This t directory contains all the test files following the TAP naming convention.

Using this structure makes it easier to maintain and organize tests, as well as to run them in the correct order. This is especially important when tests depend on the results of previous tests, or when you want to ensure that tests are executed in a specific sequence.

Here's an example of a project directory structure using the TAP-related naming convention:
```
my_project/
│
├─ src/
│   ├── function1.sql
│   ├── function2.sql
│   └── function3.sql
│
└─ t/
    ├── 00-test.sql
    ├── 01-another-test.sql
    └── 02-yet-another-test.sql
```
In this example, the project contains a src directory for the source code (database functions) and a t directory for the test files following the TAP naming convention.


#### Conclusion:
Setting up pgTap for testing database functions is straightforward and provides numerous benefits, including ensuring code quality and simplifying the testing process. This guide should serve as a starting point for setting up pgTap, and we encourage you to explore the pgTap documentation and Josh Tolley's blog post for more in-depth information on writing and running tests with pgTap. By integrating pgTap in projects like EpiTrax, it's possible to improve overall database performance, stability, and security.
