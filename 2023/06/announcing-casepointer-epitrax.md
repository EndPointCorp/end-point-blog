End Point is pleased to announce CasePointer, the expanded branding of our line of public health systems and services. Before this we referred to it simply by the name of one of its components, EpiTrax.

The name CasePointer more appropriately reflects the broad scope of services we provide within the disease reporting and surveillance sector.

This change coincides with the launching of the dedicated CasePointer website at [www.casepointer.com](https://www.casepointer.com/) and our participation next week in this year’s conference of CSTE (Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists) in Salt Lake City, Utah. We will be staffing a booth there on the exhibition floor. Come visit us!

Starting in 2008, End Point helped develop and maintain the TriSano open source disease surveillance system. In 2019 we migrated our customer, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, from TriSano to a new disease surveillance system called EpiTrax, which was developed by the state of Utah, and is also open source.

This timeline shows those and other key points on our journey:

Due to the need for major additional features and capabilities, especially since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, End Point is now integrally involved with public health agencies in four states. For each of them we configured, deployed, maintain, and enhance the cloud hosting, relevant software, and databases to run those components they need, including:

* the EpiTrax disease surveillance system
* EMSA (the Electronic Message Staging Area)
* the NMI (NNDSS Modernization Initiative) module
* End Point’s Disease Reporting Portal
* End Point’s merge tool
* Mirth Connect

All of these interoperate harmoniously around the central EpiTrax application and database.

Our team is composed of public health professionals, software engineers, database specialists, and security experts. We are committed to our public health clients and their needs. We are here to help you help our communities and look forward to discussing the CasePointer approach with you and your team.
