### Showcase destinations

VisionPort's ability to showcase destinations through interactive panoramic views and virtual tours is a game-changer for the tourism industry. By providing immersive and engaging content, potential visitors can get a real sense of what it would be like to experience a particular destination. This can help to spark their interest and inspire them to plan a trip to that location.

With its support for a variety of media types, including panoramic views, photos, and videos, VisionPort enables businesses to create high-quality content that highlights their unique features and attractions. For instance, a resort or hotel can create panoramic views of its grounds, showing off its pools, restaurants, and other amenities. These views can be further enhanced by overlaying information about the features and services available.

Moreover, VisionPort allows businesses to create maps and guides that display the different attractions and points of interest within a destination. Visitors can explore the map and click on various locations to learn more about them with photos, videos, and other relevant information. For instance, a map of a city could point to different neighborhoods, museums, and restaurants, allowing visitors to plan their itinerary before arriving at the destination. This way, visitors have a more engaging and personalized experience while exploring the destination.

Overall, VisionPort’s ability to feature destinations through interactive panoramic views and maps provides an innovative and powerful tool for the tourism industry. It enables businesses to create high-quality and engaging content that can inspire potential visitors to experience a destination for themselves, thereby boosting the tourism industry as a whole.

### Display a multitude of media

VisionPort’s support for a wide range of media types, including GIS map layers, customizable graphics, videos, and panoramic media, is a key feature that can help destinations create immersive content that illustrates their unique features and attractions. By leveraging these different media types, destinations offer a more personalized and engaging experience to potential visitors, which can be a powerful motivator for them to plan a visit.

For example, videos can be a great way to exhibit the sights and sounds of a destination, allowing viewers to see the beauty of the landscape, the energy of the local culture, and the excitement of various activities and events that take place there. Videos can also be used to introduce key stakeholders, such as local business owners and tourism officials, and to provide an overview of the destination's history and significance.

Similarly, panoramic media offers a 360° view of a location, allowing viewers to experience the destination in a more immersive and interactive way. This is particularly useful for destinations that have unique or hard-to-reach features, such as mountain ranges, waterfalls, or historic sites, which are difficult to capture in a traditional photograph or video.

By using these different media types, destinations can create content that is not only informative but also inspiring, helping potential visitors to feel a deeper connection to the destination and motivating them to plan a trip. This can ultimately lead to increased tourism revenue and a stronger local economy.
