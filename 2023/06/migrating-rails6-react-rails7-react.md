CasePointerâ€™s disease reporting portal is built on React and Rails 6, and it's time for an upgrade to Rails 7. This blog post will cover the steps, benefits, and challenges of migrating from Rails 6 to Rails 7, and offer valuable insights into the world of Ruby on Rails.

With the recent release of Rails 7, there are many new features and improvements to explore.
One of the biggest changes in Rails 7 is the retirement of Webpacker in favor of using the native webpack for bundling JavaScript.

> For those who are not familiar, Webpacker is a Rails gem which is a wrapper around the webpack build system that provides a standard webpack configuration and reasonable defaults.

### Steps for migrating Rails 6 React to Rails 7 React

To migrate a Rails 6 React application to Rails 7 React, follow these steps:

#### 1. Update the Rails Gem in the Gemfile

In your application's Gemfile, update the Rails gem version to Rails 7:

```diff
-gem "rails", "~> 6.1.4"
+gem "rails", "~> 7.0.0"
```

#### 2. Upgrade Rails packages

Upgrade the Rails packages using Yarn:

```plain
yarn upgrade @rails/actioncable --latest
yarn upgrade @rails/activestorage --latest
```

#### 3. Run the Rails update task

Run the following command to initiate the Rails update task:

```plain
bin/rails app:update
```

This task guides you file by file to integrate the new Rails 7 defaults. Refer to the [Rails documentation](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html) for detailed information on this update task.

#### 4. Remove Webpacker

Since Webpacker is no longer the default in Rails 7, follow these steps to remove it:

Remove the webpacker gem from your Gemfile:

```diff
-gem 'webpacker', '~> 4.0'
```

Remove the `webpacker.yml` file and any other files associated with webpacker.

Run `bundle install` to update the Gemfile.lock:

```plain
bundle install
```

#### 5. Setting up Webpack

To set up Webpack for your Rails 7 React application, follow these steps:

Install webpack and other necessary libraries:

```plain
yarn install webpack webpack-cli @babel/core
```

Create a webpack.config.js file at the root of your application:

```javascript
// webpack.config.js

const path = require("path");
const webpack = require("webpack");
// Add other necessary plugins and configurations

module.exports = {
  // Webpack configuration options
  output: {
    // Make sure to use the path of the rails asset pipeline
    path: path.join(__dirname, '/app/assets/builds'),
    // ...
  }
  module: {
    rules: [
      // Add CSS/SASS/SCSS rule with loaders
      {
        test: /\.(?:sa|sc|c)ss$/i,
        use: [MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader, 'css-loader', 'sass-loader'],
      },
      {
        test: /\.(png|jpe?g|gif|eot|woff2|woff|ttf|svg)$/i,
        use: 'file-loader',
      },
      {
        test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: "babel-loader"
        }
      }
    ],
  },
  // ...
};
```

Add a .babelrc file for Babel configuration:

```json
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"]
}
```

Update the scripts section in your package.json:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "webpack",
    "dev": "webpack --watch"
  }
}
```

#### 6. Update Rails asset tags

In your application views, update the asset tags from `stylesheet_pack_tag` and `javascript_pack_tag` to `stylesheet_link_tag` and `javascript_include_tag`, respectively:

```erb
<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'application', media: 'all', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %>
<%= javascript_include_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %>
```

#### 7. Start the dev server

Start the Rails development server with:

```plain
rails server
```

Then start the React development server with:

```plain
yarn run dev
```

By following these steps, we can take advantage of the new features and improvements in Rails 7 while continuing to leverage the power of React.
