Yesterday, I spent the entire day at a [Postgres Developers meeting](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PgCon_2009_Developer_Meeting), discussing what happened over the last year, and how we’re going to tackle a series of critical problems in the next year. We talked about [how to get the Synchronous Replication and Hot Standby patches completed](http://petereisentraut.blogspot.com/2009/05/pgcon-2009-second-day.html), important adoption issues, our continued participation in the SQL Standards committee (a surprising number of people were interested!), moving forward with alpha releases after commitfests (woo!), and creating a better infrastucture for managing modules and addons to Postgres. 

That evening, a few of us were treated by Paul Vallee of Pythian Group to dinner and a trip to another of Ottawa’s great local pubs. We discussed the future of open source databases and the relative quality of beer in Ottawa, Portland and the UK. Of course, I think Portland has the best beer ;) 

This morning, Dan introduced everyone to the start of the sessions, and then Dave, Magnus and I managed to get through the keynote. It was mostly an opportunity to announce [8.4 Beta2](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news.1086), plug a few of the talks and mention all the different individuals involved in development. And have a [laugh about our conference tshirts](http://yfrog.com/5jb9wj).

I have an hour and a half until I give the [Power psql](http://www.pgcon.org/2009/schedule/events/167.en.html) talk and then tonight is the big EnterpriseDB party. And one more talk tomorrow. And lightning talks. What a full conference :)
