title: 'PgCon: Preparing the keynote, more talks and today is Developer Meeting day'
---



I spent most of Tuesday polishing up slides for my [VACUUM strategy talk](http://www.pgcon.org/2009/schedule/events/184.en.html), reviewing the [Power psql](http://www.pgcon.org/2009/schedule/events/167.en.html) talk slides, working a little bit and then meeting up with all the new arrivals.

Dave Page and Greg Stark rescued [Magnus](https://www.hagander.net/blog/getting-started-at-pgcon-143/) and I from the coffee shop and we settled in at the Royal Oak for the evening. Dave, Magnus and I decided on the theme “Why people are choosing Postgres” for our keynote, and we managed to produce a few slides to guide us!

[Peter Eisentraut](http://petereisentraut.blogspot.com/2009/05/pgcon-2009-first-day.html) was there and I chatted briefly about his fun FUSE project for Postgres that he’ll be giving a [Lightning Talk](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PgCon_2009_Lightning_talks) about on Friday. (There is still time to give a lightning talk, by the way! Find me, or just update the wiki and I’ll add you to the agenda.)

I also saw CB (one of the database gurus) from [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/) there, and I’m hoping to meet up with him and a few more people this evening. Tom Lane and I chatted a little bit about my experience at MySQL Conference, and how things seem to be going with [Drizzle](https://web.archive.org/web/20090921062046/http://drizzle.org/).

All in all, had a great evening and I even survived Dave’s frequent refilling of my beer glass. I’m looking forward to today’s [Developer Meeting](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PgCon_2009_Developer_Meeting).
