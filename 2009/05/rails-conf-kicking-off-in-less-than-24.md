Less then 24 hours until RailsConf kicks off. End Point is going to be there in force this year with three of its Spree contributors attending (myself included.) Looking forward to seeing everyone out there. We’ll also be making a few big Spree related announcements so stay tuned!

If you’re a twitter user, follow me [@railsdog](https://twitter.com/railsdog). Follow Spree [@spreecommerce](https://twitter.com/spreecommerce). I’ll also be blogging the conference on [railsdog](https://web.archive.org/web/20090907135520/http://railsdog.com:80/) as well as here at the End Point blog. Finally, the [SpreeCommerce](https://spreecommerce.org/) site will be updated with various Spree related announcements.
