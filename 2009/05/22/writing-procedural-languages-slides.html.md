title: Writing Procedural Languages - slides
---

Although I'll be working to change this, the slides for [my "Writing a PostgreSQL Procedural Language" tutorial](http://www.pgcon.org/2009/schedule/track/Tutorial/159.en.html) available from the [PGCon website](http://www.pgcon.org) are from an earlier iteration of the talk. The current ones, which I used in the presentation, are available [here, on Scribd.](http://www.scribd.com/doc/15729445/Developing-a-PostgreSQL-Procedural-Language)
