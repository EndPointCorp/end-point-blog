Tomorrow we’ll be having an [Interchange community meeting on IRC](http://www.icdevgroup.org/i/dev/news?mv_arg=00037). All Interchange users and any other interested parties are invited to participate.

Also, just recently, End Point’s own [David Christensen joined the Interchange Development Group](http://www.icdevgroup.org/i/dev/news?mv_arg=00036) and became a core committer. Congratulations, David, and keep up the good work!
