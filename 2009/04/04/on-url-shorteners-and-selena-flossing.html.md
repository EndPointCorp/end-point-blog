title: On URL Shorteners and Selena FLOSSing
---



I just read an interesting article on the [various downsides to URL shorteners](http://joshua.schachter.org/2009/04/on-url-shorteners). Let’s not break the Internet that way. I found the article on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), which I’d forgotten about—​this is the Hacker News at Y Combinator, not the good ol’ but long-dead Hacker News Network formerly at hackernews.com.

In other news, our very own Selena Deckelmann appears in moving pictures at [FLOSS Weekly 64](https://web.archive.org/web/20090408235721/http://odtv.me:80/2009/04/01/floss-weekly-64/)! I haven’t even had time to watch it all yet.
