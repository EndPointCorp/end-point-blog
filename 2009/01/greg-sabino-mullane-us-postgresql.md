Belated congratulations to End Point’s [Greg Sabino Mullane](/blog/authors/greg-sabino-mullane/) for his election to the United States PostgreSQL Association’s [board for 2009-2011](https://web.archive.org/web/20120111085332/https://postgresql.us/node/65/). It didn’t really happen this way, but I think of Greg taking over [Selena’s board position](http://www.chesnok.com/daily/2008/08/28/leaving-us-postgresql-assoc-whats-next-for-me/) there. (Actually [Bruce Momjian filled that role](https://web.archive.org/web/20120111105438/https://www.postgresql.us/node/24) till the elections.)

Anyway, nice work, all of you, on improving and promoting a great database and its equally important community.
