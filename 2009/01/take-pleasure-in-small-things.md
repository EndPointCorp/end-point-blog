We’re in the midst of our 2009 company meeting, and are having our first-ever “hackathon”. The engineering team is divided into several working groups focusing on a variety of free software projects.

As a distributed organization, we don’t always get a lot of opportunity to write code and do our “real work” side-by-side like this. And it’s a pleasure to witness and to participate.

Just thought I’d share.
