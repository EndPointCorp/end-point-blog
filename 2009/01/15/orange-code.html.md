I’ve been reading the new book [The Orange Code](https://www.amazon.com/Orange-Code-Direct-Succeeded-Being/dp/0470287233/), the story of [ING Direct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ING_Group#ING_Direct_United_States) by Arkadi Kuhlmann and Bruce Philp. Here are a few passages I liked from what I read today:

> The commitment to constantly learn is the only fair way to bring everyone in the company under the same umbrella. It is a leveler. (p. 213)

#

> … [W]e’ve got to earn it each day, and we need to feel that we have new challenges that can make us or break us every day. … Each day’s work will last only as long as it’s relevant. … [W]e did okay in each of the last seven years, but we are only ever as good as our last year, our last day, our last transaction. We still have a lot to do, since our competition is not resting. (pp. 208–209)

#

> Trust and faith not only are built over time, but they actually need the passage of time to validate them. (p. 197)

#

> Contributing is a privilege earned, not a right. And there are, indeed, bad ideas, most of which are answers to questions the contributors didn’t really understand in the first place. There is a reason why some of the world’s finest jazz musicians were classically trained: You have to understand the rules before you can intelligently improvise on them. (p. 195)
