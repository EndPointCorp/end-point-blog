Today, the [June issue of the Open Source Business Review](https://web.archive.org/web/20090605162323/http://www.osbr.ca/ojs/index.php/osbr/issue/view/86) debuts. It features nine women who are active in open source development—​as developers, organizers and business leaders.

I wrote about [offline community](https://web.archive.org/web/20090606204353/http://www.osbr.ca/ojs/index.php/osbr/article/view/888/858), and how techies in Portland, OR manage to get connected to each other, and how they’ve encouraged participation from women. You don’t often find women at a user group or even a tech-focused meetup at a restaurant or bar. Portland, somehow, has managed to encourage the women in the community to participate and lead. I talk about what I think the factors were that led to the higher percentage of women involved in the community today.

Let me know what you think!
