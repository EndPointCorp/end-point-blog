title: 'VIM Tip of the Day: running external commands in a shell'
---



A common sequence of events when editing files is to make a change and then need to test by executing the file you edited in a shell. If you’re using vim, you could suspend your session (ctrl-Z), and then run the command in your shell.

That’s a lot of keystrokes, though. 

So, instead, you could use vim’s built-in “run a shell command”!

> 
> :!{cmd} Run a shell command, shows you the output and prompts you before returning to your current buffer.
> 

Even sweeter, is to use the vim special character for current filename: %

Here’s `:! %` in action!

A few more helpful shortcuts related to executing things in the shell: 

- `:!` By itself, runs the last external command (from your shell history)
- `:!!` Repeats the last command
- `:silent !{cmd}` Eliminates the need to hit enter after the command is done
- `:r !{cmd}` Puts the output of $cmd into the current buffer.
