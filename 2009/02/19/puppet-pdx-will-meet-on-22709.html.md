*Even zombies like puppets!*

If you live in or near Portland, OR, come join us for our first Puppet PDX meeting. We're meeting from 6-7pm, at [Paddy's](http://paddys.com) on SW 1st and Yamhill in Downtown Portland.  It's right on the MAX line.

Inspired by [Puppet](http://reductivelabs.com/trac/puppet/wiki/AboutPuppet) and the [Reductive Labs](http://reductivelabs.com/) team, we're gathering people interested in all things related to configuration management. (Not sock puppet-making, sorry!) Cfengine user? Thinking about trying AutomateIt? Just have a pile of obsessively managed scripts? Come on down! We'll discuss tools, best practices, and generally how to make your systems run so well you can get to the pub by 4 o'clock.

This is the first meetup. Hopefully we can get organized, get to know each other, and decide on what the goals of the group should be.

So if you are interested in automation, configuration management, cloud computing, and large scale computing environments, come join us for a few drinks and some lively chatter.

Please RSVP by sending an email to puppetpdx@reductivelabs.com so that we can get a bigger room if needed.
