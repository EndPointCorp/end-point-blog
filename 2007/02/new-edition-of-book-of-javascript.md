The Book of JavaScript (2nd edition) is a new and comprehensive introduction to the JavaScript language presented in an entertaining, practical format. I have significant practical experience with JavaScript, so I do not consider myself in the target audience for this book; however, I still found much of it useful so it will remain as a valuable reference on my bookshelf.

My full review of the book was just published at [OS News](https://www.osnews.com/story/17326/Book-Review-The-Book-of-JavaScript/).
