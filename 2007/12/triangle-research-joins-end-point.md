End Point is pleased to announce the merging of the web development and hosting firm Triangle Research into our company as of December 1, 2007. Triangle brings with it much experience in the Interchange development sphere, as well as a vibrant hosting and support business. With this addition to our team, End Point increases its diversity of skills and knowledge while gaining many exciting clients. Carl Bailey, owner of Triangle, will continue his leadership role as he manages his former Triangle employees Richard Templet and Chris Kershaw, along with Dan Collis-Puro, a veteran End Point engineer.

At the same time, End Point ranks are growing further as we welcome two other excellent developers. With sharp programming abilities in the diverse areas of low-level systems and web applications development, Charles Curley and Jordan Adler will be a good fit and we're excited to have them on board.
