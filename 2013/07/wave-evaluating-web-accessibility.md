It’s been far too long since I wrote a blog article! I’ve been a bit preoccupied:

My [cute] preoccupation.

I thought I’d start with a short blog article to get back into it. Recently, the [H2O](https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/research/h2o) project has been keeping me busy. One interesting resource I’ve been using for the project is [WAVE](http://wave.webaim.org/). WAVE is a free web accessibility evaluation tool, which in our case helps us evaluate the H2O web application for it’s use in an academic setting for those users with disabilities. The tool helps to evaluate accessibility against [Section 508](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_508_Amendment_to_the_Rehabilitation_Act_of_1973), [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php), and more.

To use the tool, you simply visit [https://wave.webaim.org/](https://wave.webaim.org/) and type in the URL that you want evaluated:

WAVE homepage

The results show warnings and alerts, as well as feedback regarding other structural markup overlayed on the page. The results are meant to serve as a resource to make decisions regarding accessibility. Some web application developers may be more inclined to follow the guidelines than others.
