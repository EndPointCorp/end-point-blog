While working on the Proxmox machine setup and specifically on the IPv6 connectivity I found a problem where after a reboot I always kept getting the *** net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding*** and all related variable set to ***0***, thus giving lots of IPv6 network connectivity issues on the guests.

While brainstorming with a colleague on this, we discovered in the boot logs these few messages which are quite indicative of something horrible happening at boot:

```
# less /var/log/boot.0

The following steps would be to either crawl through the “inextricable” maze of the ProxMox (PVE) boot initrd image and probably came up with the solution or find a quick way to deal with this in a clean way without touching the boot process.

Since it was all due to ***sysctl*** being called too early in the boot process and then not finding proper IPv6 module already loaded calling it again *later* would suffice. So I simply added the following line to ***/etc/network/interfaces***

```
iface eth0 inet6 static
address    YOUR:IPV6:IS:HERE
netmask    64
up ip -6 route add default via fe80::1 dev eth0
up sysctl -p # <------ ADDED THIS LINE TO FIX IPv6 CONNECTIVITY ISSUES
```

And there it goes. Reboot once again to verify and you should be all set.
