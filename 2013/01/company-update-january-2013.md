With the busy holiday season just behind us, we haven’t had as much time to write blog posts about what we’ve been doing in the past few months. So here’s an update on some of our latest projects:

- Brian Buchalter has been implementing new features for of a major release of **Collaborative Software Initiative**’s open source product, **TriSano**, which provides case and outbreak management, surveillance and analytics for global public health.

- [Dave](/blog/authors/dave-jenkins) has worked on deepening our contacts with content providers and agencies using or interested in using the **Liquid Galaxy** platform. Recently back from **Japan**, Dave sold a Liquid Galaxy system to a research group in Kyoto.

- [David](/blog/authors/david-christensen) has been working on an HA (highly available) **PostgreSQL** database system with automatic failover, dynamic node creation/population, and configuration synchronization.

- [Greg Sabino Mullane](/blog/authors/greg-sabino-mullane) has been speeding up slow queries, debugging pg_bouncer problems, expanding the abilities of **Bucardo**, and many other PostgreSQL-related activities.

- Jeff has been working on some major updates to the **HydroPool** site, including adding a set of “parts” products from an external supplier, with an interface that displays the schematic diagram of selected pool products and offers a way to order parts based on the exploded diagram. This has involved extensive amounts of AJAX/JSON, both in the customer UI and in the background, allowing a hierarchical drill-down into the categories, manufacturers and models.

- [Jon](/team/jon-jensen) has been helping tackle **scalability** problems at two busy sites using PHP and MySQL, and has done some system intrusion forensics and cleanup work as well as implemented some **PCI compliance** remedies. He has also been working with international payments, upgrading some outdated servers, and hiring new people to help out with development and system administration.

- [Josh Tolley](/team/josh-tolley) has been working on improving ocean-related content for **Liquid Galaxy**, and making new and better ways to display that content. He has also been working on **TriSano** for the Collaborative Software Initiative.

- [Kamil](/blog/authors/kamil-ciemniewski) has worked on making **Locate Express** multi-tenant across both the Rails-based admin area and the Sinatra-based API front end. He has also been doing browser testing for **Mobixa** and its email verification.

- [Mark](/team/mark-johnson) has been involved in developing and supporting payment APIs for our customers, primarily with **PayPal**, and investigating other processors to support **multiple currencies**. He has also been helping with moving one of our client’s file-backed sessions to database-backed sessions on **Interchange**.

- Phunk has been working as the tech lead on a large search API and metadata project using Rails 3, **ElasticSearch**, and **CouchDB**, all running on the [DevCamps](http://www.devcamps.org) system.

- [Richard](/team/richard-templet) has been setting up two new servers for **Partner Fusion**. One of these servers will be a web server using **nginx** to serve as a caching proxy to Apache for delivering PHP code. The other will be a development and database server with two **Percona MySQL** 5.5 daemons on different ports as replication slaves for two different origin servers.

- [Ron](/team/ron-phipps) helped with the setup and migration to a new server for **Lens Discounters**, launched some new shop features for **College District**, started working on a new project for **FrozenCPU**, and worked on several internal projects.

- Steph has continued working on building out features for Piggybak, including product variants, [a demo tour](/blog/2012/12/interactive-piggybak-demo-tour), and [documentation on Heroku support](/blog/2012/11/piggybak-on-heroku). She’s been involved in building out features and doing maintenence for Mobixa. For Paper Source, she has been working on full page caching via nginx, mentioned in [this article](/blog/2013/01/paper-source-nginx-full-page-caching) yesterday.

- Szymon has been working on several **Python** projects, including web and command-line applications which manage data in PostgreSQL and CouchDB databases. He has also been working on a special script creating customized **PostgreSQL** database dumps making a deep copy of part of a table with all dependent rows from other tables.

- Tim worked on a large **Rails and Solr** project, wrote an extension for Piggybak that integrates the **Stripe** payment gateway, and did some Ruby on Rails work for Mobixa.

- [Zed](/team/zed-jensen) has been working on a new timesheet app for **Android** which will let us enter our work time on the go without an Internet connection.

We also recently welcomed new full-time employees **Bianca Rodrigues**, [Will Plaut](/team/will-plaut), and **Miguel Alatorre**, who are quickly getting up to speed.

Happy new year, everyone!
