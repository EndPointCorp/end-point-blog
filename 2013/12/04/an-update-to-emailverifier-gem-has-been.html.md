title: An update to the email_verifier gem has been released
---



I have just released a newer version of the email_verifier gem. It now supports Rails localization out of the box.

**If you are one of gem’s users—​you can safely update your Bundles!**

With this release, the project has also gained its first contributors. Some time ago, one of gem’s users—​Franscesco Gnarra has asked me about a possibility of having validation messages localized. While I was planning to do it myself—​Francesco took an action and contributed to the project himself.

The project also received a pull request from another Rails developer—​Maciej Walusiak. His commit provided a way to handle Dnsruby::NXDomain exceptions.

It’s great to see that our work is helpful for others. If you’d like to contribute yourself—​I invite you to do so.
