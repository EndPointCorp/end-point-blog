title: 'Internal Tidbits: Links, Resources, Tools'
---

Here at End Point, we have a broad range and depth of knowledge in many areas of web development, both server side and client side. This shows itself in form of many internal emails. Whenever I get an internal email with some tidbit of information I’d like to read later on, I file it in my *Internal* folder to read about later. That folder is overflowing now, and I wanted to take some time to clean it out and share the contents in blog form.

- A while back, [Jon](/team/jon_jensen) shared a link to [superhero.js](http://superherojs.com/), which is an aggregate of the best articles, videos and presentations on creating, testing, and maintaining large JavaScript code bases.
- Jon also shared a link to [Coding, Fast and Slow: Developers and the Psychology of Overconfidence](http://blog.hut8labs.com/coding-fast-and-slow.html). This is an article about estimating projects, which is so inherent in our work.
- Phunk told us about the file finder tool in github: if you go to a repo in github and click “t”, it activates the file finder and you can find files by fragments of the filename. Holy cow – I’m just reading this email now and tried it out for the first time!
- Jon shared a link to [Git Best Practices](http://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/) by Seth Robertson.
- Jon (*side note: This Jon “character” must send a lot of emails!*) told us about [explainshell.com](https://explainshell.com/), which is a handy web tool that outputs the help text for the command and each argument.
- A couple of weeks ago, one of our developers sent a request looking for a free or inexpensive application which gives clients the ability to generate rough wireframes for a new web app. The responses included [draw.io](https://draw.io) and [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).
- Jon shared a [The Developer’s RegEx Survival Guide: 15 Rules for Making Sense of Regular Expressions](https://blog.smartbear.com/development/the-developers-regex-survival-guide-15-rules-for-making-sense-of-regular-expressions/). This has a lot of great tips.
- Finally, another developer recently asked for a zip code location software or service. Some options that came up were [Ultimate Locator](https://www.ultimatelocator.com/), [Bullseye location software](https://www.bullseyelocations.com/), [Geosprawl](http://www.geosprawl.com/pricing/tabid/923/Default.aspx), [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distancematrix/) and [zip-codes.com](https://www.zip-codes.com/).

My *Internal* folder is now clean and I’m ready to hear about more great tips & tools from my coworkers.
