title: It's Time Once Again for MountainWest RubyConf!
---

It’s one of my favorite times of the year. This will be my third trip to Salt Lake City to attend [Mountain West Ruby Conference](). One of ther really great things about developing in ruby is the amazing community. Hanging out with fellow developers and enthusiasts is very envigorating and so much fun.

This year I will be blogging on all the talks and reporting on some of the great stuff that will be presented. You can checkout the [MWRC Schedule](http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/2013/schedule) to see some of the great speakers in the lineup. You can follow the [#mwrc](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23mwrc&src=typd) tag on twitter to follow this amazing conference.
