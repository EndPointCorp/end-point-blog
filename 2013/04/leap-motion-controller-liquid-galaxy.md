We’re constantly trying out new things with our Liquid Galaxy at End Point: new content types, new remote management scripts, new hardware. The good people at [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) sent over one of their hand motion controllers and we couldn’t wait to get it unpacked and driving the Liquid Galaxy that sits in our office.

With access to developer tools, we were able to configure the Leap Motion and update the device firmware. Then, after a quick installation of the latest Google Earth build v 7.1.1.1550 that includes Leap Motion controller support, we were ready to test out the new device on our 7-screen Liquid Galaxy.

Watch the video and see for yourself—​we think the combination is fantastic! That superhero feeling of flying around the world with a Liquid Galaxy is only enhanced that much more by now commanding the movement of the planet with subtle flexing of your fingers. (That’s Kiel in the video—​personally, I think he looks like Magneto without the helmet.)

End Point continues to push the boundaries on what the Liquid Galaxy can do. We want to experiment some more and see what else might be possible with the Leap Motion controller for Google Street View, panoramic photos, videos, and maybe even games. If you’ve got an idea, or if you have a cool place where this might be deployed, please contact us!
