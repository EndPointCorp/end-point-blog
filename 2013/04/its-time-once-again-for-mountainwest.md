Itâ€™s one of my favorite times of the year. This will be my third trip to Salt Lake City to attend [Mountain West Ruby Conference](https://web.archive.org/web/20130417043214/http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/). One of ther really great things about developing in ruby is the amazing community. Hanging out with fellow developers and enthusiasts is very envigorating and so much fun.

This year I will be blogging on all the talks and reporting on some of the great stuff that will be presented. You can checkout the [MWRC Schedule](https://web.archive.org/web/20180429195521/http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/2013/schedule) to see some of the great speakers in the lineup. You can follow the [#mwrc](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23mwrc&src=typd) tag on twitter to follow this amazing conference.
