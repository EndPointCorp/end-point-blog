Once again [The Liquid Galaxy Project](http://code.google.com/p/liquid-galaxy) has been accepted as a mentoring organization for the [Google Summer of Code](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013) program! The Google Summer of Code program (AKA GSoC) provides a tremendous opportunity for talented undergraduate and graduate students to work developing Open Source software guided by a mentor. Students receive $5000 stipends for successfully completing their summer projects. The past two years The Liquid Galaxy Project has had three GSoC students successfully complete their projects each year. This year we are hoping to increase this number.

Right now we are in the "would-be student participants discuss application ideas with mentoring organizations" phase of the program. Interested students should contact the project's mentors and admins (which includes a goodly number of End Pointers) by emailing lg-gsoc@endpoint.com or by jumping into the #liquid-galaxy Freenode IRC channel. Applicants are well advised to take advantage of the opportunity to consult with project mentors in developing their applications. Student applications are being accepted starting April 22 and must be submitted by May 3. [The definitive timeline for the Google Summer of Code program with the exact time of the student application deadline](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2013) should be consulted by interested students. Applications for the Liquid Galaxy Project's GSoC program should be emailed to [lg-gsoc@endpoint.com](mailto:lg-gsoc@endpoint.com).

The Liquid Galaxy GSoC 2013 Ideas Page is at [http://code.google.com/p/liquid-galaxy/wiki/GSoC2013Ideas](http://code.google.com/p/liquid-galaxy/wiki/GSoC2013Ideas). We are interested in project proposals based on all the topics listed there and in other ideas from students for projects that will advance the capabilities of Liquid Galaxy. This past year has seen wonderful advances on the Liquid Galaxy, with great improvements in the display of Street View, panoramic photography and video, Google Maps, and more. This summer we will have weekly Hangouts for all students and mentors and other interested community members. The Hangouts will provide concrete support for our students in their projects.

The FAQ for the 2013 Google Summer of Code program is located at [https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2013/help_page](https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2013/help_page).

If you are a student with programming chops who likes Open Source software you should look at the Google Summer of Code program and apply to one or more of the great projects in the program. If you know of students who you think would be a good fit for the program you'll be doing a good deed by encouraging them to check it out. And by all means, if you are interested in the Liquid Galaxy Project jump in and [contact us](mailto:lg-gsoc@endpoint.com)!
