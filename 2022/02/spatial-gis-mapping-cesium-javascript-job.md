We are looking for a **full-time JavaScript developer for geospatial web applications** using GIS data, mapping, and 3D imagery, to work with us on our clients’ applications. Location somewhere in the Western Hemisphere is preferred.

End Point Dev is an Internet technology consulting company based in New York City. We have about 50 employees serving many clients ranging from small family businesses to large corporations. We are going strong after 26 years in business!

Even prior to the pandemic most of us worked remotely from our home offices. We collaborate using project tracking tools, GitHub/​GitLab/​Bitbucket, Zulip chat, video conferencing, and of course email and phones.

### What you will be doing:

- Build on open source software and contribute back when possible.

### Professional development experience you'll need:

- **2+ years of development with JavaScript, TypeScript, and/or Node.js for geospatial applications**
- Frameworks and libraries such as CesiumJS, Three.js, Leaflet, OpenStreetMap, KML, Mapbox, PostGIS, WebGL, Google Maps API, React, Vue.js, Angular
- Databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis
- Familiarity with the Linux operating system and shell
- Git version control

### You have these important work traits:

- Strong spoken and written communication skills
- A good eye for detail
- Tenacity in solving problems
- Work both independently and as part of a team

### What work here offers:

- Collaboration with knowledgeable, friendly, helpful, and diligent co-workers around the world
- Flexible and sane work hours

- For U.S. employees, health insurance subsidy and 401(k) retirement savings plan

### Get in touch with us:

Please email us an introduction to jobs@endpointdev.com to apply. Include your location, a resume/​CV, your LinkedIn or other profile URLs, and whatever else may help us get to know you.

We look forward to hearing from you! Note that this role is not for agencies or subcontractors—direct work seekers only.
