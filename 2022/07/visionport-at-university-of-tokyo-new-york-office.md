Technology and education go hand in hand, and the VisionPort platform is being used every day to make that connection. 

We are extremely honored to be able to contribute to the [first exhibition at the University of Tokyo’s New York office](https://labo.wtnv.jp/2022/07/convergence2022en.html), “Convergence of Peace Activities: Connecting and Integrating by Technologies”.

It is said that those who do not learn from history are condemned to repeat it, and in that vein, the exhibition, drawing from the work of Professor Hidenori Watanave, will be using the VisionPort platform to educate viewers on the realities of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, on the date of the 77th anniversary of the first nuclear weapon used in war.

The team has been collecting and colorizing photographic material from the aftermath of the bombings for over 10 years. The exhibition will combine that work with interviews and writings from survivors on a GIS canvas to allow attendees to see what it looked like and to hear from those who were there.

The lab will also be presenting the work they have been doing covering the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Day by day they collect the latest images from the war, identify the locations of the events and use geospatial data to map and present it in an interactive, 3D environment.

The exhibition will serve to show us where we have been and where we are now, in hopes of being a “convergence,” a place to connect and use all of our available information and technologies so that we may begin a new era of understanding and in turn, peace.

The exhibition will also feature work done by [Co-Op Peace Map](https://coop.archiving.jp/), [Mainichi Newspaper](https://mainichi.jp/english/) and the University of Kyoto. 

The educational work that the University of Tokyo is doing with the VisionPort platform is inspiring and we look forward to being there to see it in memoriam of that fateful day.
