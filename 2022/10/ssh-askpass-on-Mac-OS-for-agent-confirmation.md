At End Point Dev we mostly use the SSH keys for authentication when connecting to remote servers and Git services. The majority of the time, the servers we are trying to visit are barred from direct access and require a middle "jump server" instead.

Enabling SSH Agent Forwarding makes it easier to reuse the SSH private keys. It keeps the private keys on our local machine to authenticate with each server in the chain without entering a password.

However, this approach comes with an inherent risk where the agent can be hijacked. This means a bad guy could use the SSH keys to compromise downstream servers.

In this post, we’ll cover a simple way to protect against SSH Agent Hijacking. Also, we will see in detail how to configure a system-wide agent that runs under GUI for agent confirmation using ssh-askpass.

## ssh-askpass - Agent Confirmation

It is strongly recommended to use the `-c` option on `ssh-add` command when adding your ssh keys to the ssh-agent in order to protect yourself against SSH Agent Hijacking.

Agent forwarding has some inherent risk, however, this risk may be significantly reduced by using this `-c` option.

When utilizing the ssh-askpass, a prompt will show on your local computer to confirm the usage of the key each time a request is made to use the private key loaded in the SSH agent. Doing this makes it harder for an attacker to utilize the private key without permission.

If case if you don’t want to use agent confirmation, then it’s best to use ProxyJump instead of agent forwarding.


### Install ssh-askpass with Homebrew
```
$ brew tap theseal/ssh-askpass
$ brew install ssh-askpass
```
You might see some warnings. Go ahead and proceed with them.

### Install ssh-askpass with MacPorts
```
$ sudo port install ssh-askpass
```

### Install ssh-askpass from Source Code
```
$ cp ssh-askpass /usr/local/bin/
$ cp ssh-askpass.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
$ launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ssh-askpass.plist
```

## Start the Homebrew Services
Note that it’s a `brew service` not just a regular daemon service.

```
$ brew services start theseal/ssh-askpass/ssh-askpass
=> Successfully started `ssh-askpass` (label: homebrew.mxcl.ssh-askpass)

```
Behind the scenes, it just sets the `SSH_ASKPASS` and `SUDO_ASKPASS` environment variables and stops `ssh-agent`,  so that the ssh-agent can pick up these environment variables when it restarts.


To List the services and make sure it’s started
```
$ brew services list | grep ssh-askpass
ssh-askpass started ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.ssh-askpass.plist
```

## Configure the ssh-agent with `-c` option

* Let's first verify that the ssh-agent is running and then add the private key with ` -c `option.

* The Identity will get added if you provide the correct passphrase for the key. This can be confirmed by listing the keys again.

## ssh-askpass agent confirmation
* Let's log into a remote server
* It will be prompted to confirm the private key’s usage with the pop-up window.

## Setup keyboard shortcuts
Since it's too easy to hit the spacebar and accept a connection, ssh-askpass defaults to the cancel option, and we can use the keyboard shortcuts to press `OK` by following the below steps.

* Go to `System Preferences` and then `Keyboard`.

#### 10.15+
* Go to `Shortcuts` tab
* check the option ` Use keyboard navigation to move focus between controls`.

#### 13.0 Ventura
* Turn on the option ` Use keyboard navigation to move focus between controls `

Now you can press the tab ⇥ and then the spacebar to press `OK`.

Enjoy!
