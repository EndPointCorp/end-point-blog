I guess this is the longest break between posts in this [series](/blog/tags/spring-kafka-series/). But finally I had a chance to prepare a working example to finalize this series. So, up-to-date code is available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ashemez/SpringKafkaMessaging).

### Activation and Login

This was already implemented in the previous parts. However, we haven't shown it in action yet. There are some code fixes and small changes within the workflow of activation and login steps, so you can refer to the GitHub repository for the latest code.

Authentication and activation are managed through the `AuthController` class where these activation and login requests are handled. Let's take a look at the `REST` endpoints handling these requests and explain the steps.

#### Activation

Our activation step uses a dummy mobile phone number. You can think of it similarly to activating a messaging application (like WhatsApp) using a phone number. I didn't introduce any restrictions on the phone number for this application, so the phone number activation is just a pseudo-step and you can supply any number. In real life, the phone number activation would use SMS or other activation services to activate your chat application against the user's phone number.

The activation endpoint is `/api/auth/getcode`, and takes the mobile number as payload. A sample POST request is below:

```plain
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST localhost:8080/api/auth/getcode -d '{ "mobile": "01234" }'
```

The response of this endpoint is of the class `ActivationResponse` which, in return, gives an activation code along with the provided mobile number. This `activationCode` will later be used to login and retrieve an access token for further loginless connections. Here is an example output of this response:

```json
{
  "mobile": "01234",
  "activationCode": "309652"
}
```

We provide a random `activationCode` and the client now needs to use this activation code to move one step further towards getting an access token for further authentication.

#### Login

The login step is supposed to be a one-time login after getting the activation code (phone number) which is used for login credentials. Our application returns an access token in return. The login endpoint is `/api/auth/login`. Request and response examples are below.

```plain
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST localhost:8080/api/auth/login -d '{ "mobile": "01234", "activationCode": "309652" }'
```

POSTing to the login endpoint returns an access token. The access token is needed to make message-sending requests so that the client can be authenticated. Storing locally and reusing this access token is the responsibility of the client.

```json
{
  "accessToken": "5eab27f8-8748-4fdc-a4de-ac782ce17a74"
}
```

### Chat Application

The chat application is the final part of this series, and will show the messaging in action. The chat application is designed as a simple proof of concept and simulates a chatting session.

To add a web UI to our Spring application I've added two static files, `app.js` and `index.html`, in the `resources` directory. `index.html` serves as the chat application's UI and `app.js` is responsible for making AJAX calls and WebSocket connections from the client browser.

![Three text boxes. The first is labeled "Mobile number (pretend) activation", and an "Activate" button follow. The next is labeled "login" with a "Login" button following. The next is labeled "Access Token, with no button following immediately. There is then a label reading "Chat Application:", followed by two buttons reading "Start New Chat" and "End Chat", in order from top to bottom.](/blog/2022/10/messaging-app-spring-kafka-pt-five/kafkamessagewebui.webp)

I added all three steps to the chat application UI to make the workflow clearer. As you see in the chat screen above, these three steps are activation, login, and starting a new chat. Let's walk through these steps.

#### Activation and login through the chat application

Activation simply requires a pretend mobile phone number. When you click on `Activate` it sends a POST request to the `/api/auth/getcode` end point we mentioned above.

```javascript
function activate() {
  var mobileFormData = JSON.stringify({
    'mobile': $("#mobile").val(),
  });

  $.ajax({
    type: "POST",
    url: "http://localhost:8080/api/auth/getcode",
    data: mobileFormData,
    contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8",
    success: function(result) {
      $("#activationCode").val(result.activationCode);
    },
  });
}
```

The resulting `activationCode` is automatically inputted into the `login` field. We already know what this `activationCode` is and where it is stored in the backend, so now our chat client can use this along with the mobile number to log in and get the access token. When you click on `Login` it POSTs to `/api/auth/login` and puts the access token into the `Access Token` input box this time.

```javascript
function login() {
  var loginFormData = JSON.stringify({
    'mobile': $("#mobile").val(),
    'activationCode': $("#activationCode").val(),
  });

  $.ajax({
    type: "POST",
    url: "http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login",
    data: loginFormData,
    contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8",
    success: function(result) {
      $("#accessToken").val(result.accessToken);
    },
  });
}
```

Now finally our web client can connect to our WebSocket URI. Without a login step we could let our application accept WebSocket connections as well. However, we simulated an authentication step and we want to know who is connecting to the WebSocket handler.

```javascript
function connect() {
  ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080/messaging?accessToken=' + $("#accessToken").val());
    ws.addEventListener('error', (error) => {
    console.log("Error: ", error.message);
    setConnected(false);
    });
    ws.addEventListener('close', (event) => {
    console.log("Close: ", event.code + " - " + event.reason);
      setConnected(false);
    })
  ws.onmessage = function(event) {
    helloWorld(event.data);
    console.log("Connected to WebSocket " + event.data);
  }
  setConnected(true);
}
```

#### WebSocket Handshake

In our `WebSocketConfig` class I added an WebSocket handshake interceptor `WSHandshakeInterceptor` to authenticate the connecting user by checking the `accessToken`. So, the `accessToken` is necessary at the first step while connecting to the WebSocket registry. If the client doesn't provide an `accessToken` or provides an invalid one then the handshake will fail.

```java
@Override
public boolean beforeHandshake(ServerHttpRequest serverHttpRequest, ServerHttpResponse serverHttpResponse, org.springframework.web.socket.WebSocketHandler webSocketHandler, Map<String, Object> map) throws Exception {

    LOG.info("hand shaking for ws session url  " + serverHttpRequest.getURI().getPath() + " ? " + serverHttpRequest.getURI().getQuery());
    String parameters[] = serverHttpRequest.getURI().getQuery().split("=");

    if (parameters.length == 2 && parameters[0].equals("accessToken")) {
        String accessToken = parameters[1];

        Long senderUserId = 0L;
        String senderId = cacheRepository.getUserIdByAccessToken(accessToken);

        if (senderId == null) {
            User sender = userRepository.findByToken(accessToken);
            if(sender != null) {
                senderUserId = sender.getUserId();
            }
        } else {
            senderUserId = Long.valueOf(senderId);
        }

        LOG.info("Handshake found userId: " + senderUserId);

        if (senderUserId == 0L) {
            LOG.info("Handshake failed: user not found for given accessToken");
            map.put("CUSTOM-HEADER", "Handshake failed: user not found for given accessToken");
            return false;
        }

        map.put("CUSTOM-HEADER", "Handshake successful");
        LOG.info("Handshake successful");
        return true;
    }

    map.put("CUSTOM-HEADER", "Handshake failed: accessToken not found");
    LOG.info("Handshake failed: accessToken not found");
    return false;

}
```

If everything goes well and our web client is connected to WebSocket then the client can start sending messages to the other WebSocket sessions. We don't manage offline messaging or other capabilities in this application. As you'll see a WebSocket session will be able to send messages to only corresponding active WebSocket sessions. In real life examples you would manage offline messaging and deliver to the destination users whenever they become online.

#### Chat in action

When I open the chat application in two different browsers and login with different mobile numbers I am able to make them have a chat. I assume mobile number `01234` has two contacts `12345` and `23456` in their contact list.

On this screen I chose the `12345` contact to start messaging. I entered my message and clicked on `Send` button. Since both clients connected to the WebSocket I was able to send the message to `12345`, as you can see on the second client's window.

![Two chat windows are open, with the same layout as the previous image. The left window's layout is extended to include the following: two checkboxes reading "12345" and "23456", with the first checked. Below is a text field containing a message reading "Hey dude, howdy?". Below it is a button labeled "Send". The right window is extended to include the following: a received message reading '{"msg":"Hey dude, howdy?","senderId":4,"topic":"SEND_MESSAGE"}', then an empty text area with a "Send" button.](/blog/2022/10/messaging-app-spring-kafka-pt-five/km-chat-in-action.webp)

The messages are not tidied here; I made the WebSocket message list the message on the client where it connected to its WebSocket session.

Here is the JavaScript code sending the message to WebSocket session when you click on the `Send` button:

```javascript
function sendData() {
  var data = JSON.stringify({
    'topic': 'SEND_MESSAGE',
    'message': {
      'accessToken': $("#accessToken").val(),
      'sendTo': $("#sendTo").val(),
      'msg': $("#messageArea").val(),
    },
  })
  ws.send(data);
}
```

When we send the message to WebSocket, our `WebSocketHandler` handles the received message through WebSocket session. However, it doesn't directly send the message to the corresponding WebSocket session. We send our message to the Kafka topic `SEND_MESSAGE` using `MessageSender.send()` method at this point and Kafka manages the streaming messages.

On the Kafka listener side of our application `MessageReceiver.messagesSendToUser()` is receiving the messages and it redirects the messages to the corresponding WebSocket session. So we took this workload from the WebSocket handler to the Kafka listener so it would be busy only with the messages sent by the clients. Another approach would be sending the messages directly to Kafka topics instead of WebSocket handler so we would give all the workload to Kafka services.

```java
@KafkaListener(topics = "SEND_MESSAGE", groupId = "foo")
public void messagesSendToUser(@Payload String message, @Headers MessageHeaders headers) {

    JSONObject jsonObject = new JSONObject(message);

    LOG.info("Websocket message will be sent if corresponding destination websocket session is found");
    if (jsonObject.get("sendTo") != null
            && WebSocketPool.websockets.get(jsonObject.getLong("sendTo")) != null
            && WebSocketPool.websockets.get(jsonObject.getLong("sendTo")).size() > 0) {

        String accessToken = jsonObject.getString("accessToken");
        Long sendTo = jsonObject.getLong("sendTo");
        String msg = jsonObject.getString("msg");

        LOG.info("Websocket message is sent to " + sendTo);

        String topic = "SEND_MESSAGE";

        messageService.sendMessage(accessToken, sendTo, msg, topic);

    } else {
        LOG.info("Websocket session not found for given sendTo");
    }
}
```

Here is our logging for the message sent through the chat application.

```plain
2022-10-07 16:36:41.371  INFO 37554 --- [nio-8080-exec-1] c.e.S.websocket.WebSocketHandler         : {"topic":"SEND_MESSAGE","message":{"accessToken":"5eab27f8-8748-4fdc-a4de-ac782ce17a74","sendTo":"5","msg":"Hey dude, howdy?"}}

```

### What is the point of using Kafka and WebSocket?

Let's go back to the question of why we used Kafka and WebSockets for a messaging app. We questioned this paradigm in [part 1](/blog/2020/04/messaging-app-spring-kafka-pt-one/) of this series while discussing the design and architecture. It all depends on what you aim to do with a messaging application.

There are times when WebSocket has the advantage over HTTP or XMPP, and we can compare these protocols on a case-by-case basis. However, those debates won't be had in this post. WebSocket is simply a fast relaying and simple protocol which enables a web server app to communicate with a web browser, or more broadly, WebSocket clients, easily. So you can use WebSocket to create chat applications over the web and let the same user's multiple sessions run concurrently on multiple clients.

Kafka, on the other hand, acts as a message orchestrator, highly aware of what is coming in and going out and upwardly scalable. You are guaranteed to be able to process each message which arrives at Kafka without worrying about concurrency and delay issues which you often face with traditional threads or services. Kafka is not essentially a chat application backend but can handle the millions and even billions of messages easily. The main purpose of this example application is not creating a chat application, but as the title says, a messaging application.

So, while chatting would designate a narrow scope, messaging covers a broad range of applications handling high loads of data streaming environments.

### Conclusion

Kafka is used in several environments by lots of giants of industry and startups. A few industry examples would be financial services, telecom, manufacturing, and healthcare. You can make data streaming seamless and real-time using Kafka.
