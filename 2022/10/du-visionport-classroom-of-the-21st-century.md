VisionPort’s recent installation at the University of Denver is transforming education and has even found itself [featured in Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennifercastenson/2022/05/19/five-experts-share-data-strategies-to-survive-wild-housing-market/).

Installed in the Marion J. Crean Collaboratory room, VisionPort is doing what it does best, engaging audiences and bringing ideas to life.

The Collaboratory room gets its name from its mission, to be a collaborative laboratory, specifically for DU’s real estate and construction management students.

VisionPort was designed with geographic information systems (GIS) in mind, and the content management system we built from the ground up allows experts and novices alike to explore real estate and construction opportunities. From flying around undeveloped land, to exploring cityscapes in three dimensions, the VisionPort is the best platform for presenting GIS data.

> “What [the VisionPort] is going to give us is the opportunity to sit in class, and literally, be able to fly to any property, anywhere in the world, and walk that property, see that property.” — Dr. Barbara Jackson

Seven displays spanning 18 feet, installed in a custom case on top of a beautiful wood stage, the Collaboratory’s design is one of the most unique and intriguing yet.

The world is once again facing new real estate market conditions and the VisionPort platform is the perfect tool to assist in presenting the data needed to understand how the landscape will look over the coming years.

Developers and realtors are realizing that data is more important than ever to cope with the evolving market. Efficiency is the name of the game, and to be able to collect, analyze, and present that data is VisionPort's bread and butter.

> “Our students will walk out of here with state-of-the-art knowledge about how technology in real estate development and construction management will play in the field.” — Vivek Choudhury, dean of the Daniels College of Business.

You can hear what Dr. Barbara Jackson has to say about the Collaboratory and VisionPort’s role on DU's [Burns School YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAK2W3Utxek).

We are grateful to be able to contribute to the education experience and look forward to seeing the Collaboratory’s VisionPort play its part in what Dr. Jackson has dubbed “the classroom of the 21st century.”
