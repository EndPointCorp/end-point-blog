We are looking for an engineer to join the End Point Immersive and Geospatial Support (I+G) Team—​a small, multidisciplinary team that supports our company’s clients with their [VisionPort systems](https://www.visionport.com/) incorporating Liquid Galaxy technology. VisionPort hardware consists of large-panel HD TVs within a curved panoramic environment, supported by a server stack with power, video, audio, and network connections and equipment.

The candidate will be based out of a home office in the western United States (Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico, and Texas). The engineer will be asked to travel to, perform, and supervise system installations, in addition to day-to-day remote support work from a home office.

Occasional evenings and weekend on-call shifts are shared amongst the team.

This is a great entry-level opportunity for people already familiar with light audiovisual, server room, and/or installation handiwork to get experience with all aspects of production computer systems and their deployment.
