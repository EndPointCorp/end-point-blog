Auburn University’s Liquid Galaxy/​VisionPort installation was the first of its kind, built into a stunning wooden cabinet. A technological showpiece that is a highlight of Auburn’s campus, the VisionPort platform is used to showcase incredible imagery and presentations created by students and faculty alike. 

Auburn’s Liquid Galaxy/​VisionPort is located on the first floor of the RBD (Ralph Brown Draughon) Library. As stated on [Auburn’s Library webpage](https://lib.auburn.edu/liquidgalaxy/), “It provides a one-of-a-kind platform for 3D geospatial visualization, panoramic images, video, tours, and more in a shared immersive environment. Auburn holds the distinction of being one of the few institutions in the Southeast to make this unique and innovative resource available to its patrons.”

Chris Mixon is Auburn University’s Information Technology Specialist in the Media & Digital Resource Lab. He works closely with University groups to develop content, and also works with End Point’s support team as needs arise. As Chris has shared, “we are doing great things with this platform!” Among other projects, Chris is working with instructors and students in Urban Design Studio (CPLN 7200) and Science Communication (ESSI 7150) to display their work on the VisionPort platform. 

Auburn University’s Liquid Galaxy/​VisionPort is also used for Creative Explorations in Technology and Design programs geared toward 7th–11th graders. This program is focused on increasing digital literacy and building valuable technical skills as these middle and high school students prepare for the next stage of their lives.

We look forward to continuing to support Auburn University in leveraging the VisionPort platform for great educational uses.
