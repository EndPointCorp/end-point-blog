(QR = “Quick Response” - good to know!)

The Python QRcode generator library generates the QR codes from the secret key and outputs that into a terminal using Unicode characters, not a PNG graphic as most other libraries do. We can store that in a text file. Why would we want that?

##### Benefits of having Unicode QR code as a text file:
* Storing the QR code into a text file makes it a smaller file size compared to a PNG image.
* It is easy to read the QR code over ssh using the `cat` command, rather than downloading the file to a local workstation.
* It is simple to manage QR codes as text files in Git compared to PNG images.

This can be used for any kind of QR code, but we have found it especially useful for managing shared multi-factor authentication — MFA, also known as 2FA for 2-factor authentication — secrets for TOTP, Time-based One-Time Passwords.

### Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

Many services provide a separate account and login for each user so that accounts do not need to be shared, and thus passwords and multi-factor authentication do not need to be shared either. This is ideal, and what we insist on for the most important accounts.

But unfortunately, some services provide only a single login per account, or only a single primary account login with the other accounts being limited in serious ways (preventing access to billing, or account management, etc.) so that any business relying on them needs to share the access between several authorized users. A single point of failure in an account login is a serious problem when that one person is unavailable.

### TOTP mobile apps

There are many good mobile apps for managing TOTP keys and codes, including Aegis, FreeOTP, or Google Authenticator, and many others. (Look for one that works with no connection to the outside world, so that you won’t be stuck when off the mobile & data networks.)

Most applications support scanning QR codes with the phone’s camera, or else typing in a secret key to import the accounts.

For those shared accounts with no option for fully empowered individual user accounts, we can convert secret keys into QR codes for easy sharing and easy imports.

First, note that you should never use online QR code generators for MFA secrets! You risk exposing your extra authentication factors and defeating the purpose of your extra work.

### QRcode Python library

The QRcode Python library provides a `qr` executable that can print your QR code using UTF-8 characters on the console.

Installation

```
apt install python3-qrcode
```

Or visit https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/ 

The contents of the QR code are a URL in the format:

```
otpauth://totp/{username}?secret={key}&issuer={provider_name}
```

The provider_name can contain spaces, however, they need to be URL-encoded and entered as %20 for auth to work correctly on iOS. Otherwise, an invalid barcode error will be shown when adding the code.

For example, if you generate the QR code with key `JSZE5V4676DZFCUCFW4GLPAHEFDNY447` for the account `root@example.com`, the resulting would be:

Command:
```
$ qr "otpauth://totp/Example:root@example.com?secret=JSZE5V4676DZFCUCFW4GLPAHEFDNY447&issuer=Superhost" 
```

Providing the username and issuer will display it in the list of configured accounts in your authenticator application, e.g.: `Superhost (Example:root@example.com)`
