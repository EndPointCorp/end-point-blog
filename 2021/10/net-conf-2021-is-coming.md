![.NET 5 Platform](net-conf-2021-is-coming/dotnet-conf-2021)

[.NET â€” A unified platform](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-net-5/) by Microsoft


It's that time of the year again! It has been almost one year since .NET 5 was launched on the [.NET Conf 2020](/blog/2020/11/dotnet-5-released-net-conf-2020/), unifying .NET Framework and .NET Core into a single, open-source and cross-platform framework. And with .NET 6 around the corner, it's time to prepare for the new edition: [.NET Conf 2021](https://www.dotnetconf.net/), starting on November 9th.

### LTS (Long Term Support)

.NET 6 is a Long Term Support version, which means that it will have support for at least years after its release. The current version, .NET 5, is a General Availability (GA) version, which means it support will generally end six months after the next release is available.

### Hot reload (after some struggling)

The [Hot Reload feature](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-net-hot-reload/), which will allow to make and apply changes to the code in execution time, will be finally available in .NET 6. There was some noise about it on the past days since Microsoft made a decision to lock it to Visual Studio 2022, which is a Windows-limited mostly-paid product. But after the open source community made it clear they were angry about it, Microsoft reversed the change and the feature will be available for all platforms.

### Mobile development

We will see several changes to the web mobile app development works under .NET 6. With a smaller, optimized and optional SDK for mobile based on [Xamarin](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin), now called Multi-platform App UI or MAUI, developing an app that aims multiple mobile platforms should be simpler than ever.

Along with this, there are several optimization improvements to several aspects of the framework, including [AOT compilation](https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/comments/o21i5k/webassembly_aot_support_is_now_available_with_net/) or the [Minimal API Framework](https://dotnetcoretutorials.com/2021/07/16/building-minimal-apis-in-net-6/), along with build speed improvements. A complete list of breaking changes can be seen [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/6.0).

Although not part of the event itself, the new version of Visual Studio will also be available from November 8th, after the launch on an [online event](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/launch/) that Microsoft is preparing with several presentations from the team.


As we did last year, the .NET team at End Point will be listening to the talks and presentations from the conference, and trying out the new features that will be publicly available on November 9th. Exciting days ahead! We hope to see you there.
