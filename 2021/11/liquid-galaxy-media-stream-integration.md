End Point’s Immersive and Geospatial Division is proud to announce the rollout of our new Media Stream Integration as an extension to the Liquid Galaxy platform’s capabilities. This additional hardware can be added to existing installations or included in a new solution provided by our sales team.

The Media Stream Integration (“MSI”) is a collection of hardware additions to the Liquid Galaxy that allows a user to stream from any HDMI capable device in up to a 4k (3840×​2160 pixels) window on the main displays of the system.

With the MSI, a user can connect and share any media source directly to the system through the touchscreen. Examples include a video game console, cable TV box, DVR device, laptop or desktop computer, Plex server, and more. In other words, users can showcase media content that may not be natively supported on the Liquid Galaxy platform.

### How it works

A user simply ensures that the device is on, and it will appear as an option to share to the Liquid Galaxy screens on the touchscreen. The stream can be overlaid on top of existing content in pre-defined windows on the display wall through which the content will be displayed. When finished, the overlay window can be removed at any time.

### Why we created this

We recognize the value offered in having an impressive, high-resolution display wall, and are often asked during an installation, “Can we watch the game on those screens?” In an effort to expand the flexibility of the system, we asked ourselves, “Why not?” As a dynamic presentation system, we want to equip our clients with all the tools necessary to share their stories, including supporting external content on the system.

### Who this benefits

This is useful to anyone looking for a way to share content from a device not natively supported by the system. We are always looking for new ways to interact with the system and build content, and would love to hear your ideas.

If you are an existing client and have any questions about this new capability, or if you are considering a Liquid Galaxy platform for your organization and would like to learn more, please [contact us](https://www.visionport.com/contact/)!
