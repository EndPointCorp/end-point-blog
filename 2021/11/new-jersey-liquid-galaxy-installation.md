![Another successful Liquid Galaxy conference room](/blog/2021/11/new-jersey-liquid-galaxy-installation/banner.jpg)

End Point Dev installed a Liquid Galaxy system at the New Jersey office of one of our clients this past March. This marks the fifth office that our client is using to showcase a Liquid Galaxy, joining offices in 4 other states. This new seven-screen Liquid Galaxy system is built into a conference room wall, and will be used as a technological showpiece to allow their team and clients to view different locations, information, and datasets in an immersive and interactive environment.

As our team is headquartered in New York City, this was a relatively local installation. Our End Point Dev engineers initially spent three days installing this system at the client’s new office; however, due to unforeseen circumstances there were a couple of return trips made to finalize details and ensure the best possible product. We also provided one day of on-site system training, walking the team through using the system and creating presentations with the Content Management System.

All Liquid Galaxy content for this client has been prepared by their global marketing team, who build region-focused content for each of the different Liquid Galaxy systems. The team effectively builds interactive content that allows their staff to home in on geographic locations and share in-depth research and datasets on their seven-screen systems.

Our client has seen great success with its growing fleet of Liquid Galaxy systems. They compare the Liquid Galaxy to being in a helicopter, due to the ability to zoom in and look at real estate properties of interest.

Our client’s in-house research team also effectively uses Liquid Galaxy to visualize opportunities and trends. The team combines information from their industry dataset, with insights from daily dialogue with leaders in manufacturing and distribution.

While our client often uses Liquid Galaxy in dedicated conference rooms specifically designed to house and experience the system, they have also found success in using the platform for portable use in exhibits and trade fair expo booths.
