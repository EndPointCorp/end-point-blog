# SaaS or Custom Website?

So you need a (new?) website, but you are not sure whether you want to pay for a website provided as a monthly service (SaaS), or build a custom website and host it.

The options are plentiful, as are the reasons for building a website in the first place. The purpose of this article is not to put forward specific packages or providers for consideration, rather I want to discuss how you might go about organizing your thoughts in a way that will help you more objectively prepare for that consideration.  Also, this discussion is for a commercial website, not a personal website or blog.

Here at End Point, we receive many inquiries every month, asking for new websites.  Very few of the callers we get seem to have considered these things, let alone have created a list to help them make an informed decision.  We are well equipped to help you work through this process, and are happy to do so. But for those of you who want to "go it alone", or if you just want to be better prepared before you call us, read on for some tips on how to create this list.

While deciding between a SaaS offering and a custom build carries unlimited possibilities, there are several generalities that you can use to help you narrow down the field. 

### Experience

The foremost factor that you should consider for your pros & cons list is your experience. This may come as a little bit of a shock, as you might think that budget would be the top consideration. Budget is a very high level consideration, but don't think for a minute that either option, SaaS or custom, cannot consume almost any budget.  So before budget, comes experience.  Experience is futher divided into experience in your business, as well as experience with websites in general. For example:

In your industry, are you a 
1. Rookie 
1. Veteran

How long have you owned this business:
1. 1-3 yrs
1. 3+ yrs

Does this business have a website:
1. No
1. Yes

If yes, is it currently SaaS or Custom:
1. SaaS
1. Custom

  
If you answered "1" to 3 or more of the above questions, it's more likely that a SaaS system would be a better fit for you. 3 or more of the above answered with a "2", have you leaning towards custom. None of these questions are set in stone, but only meant to help you decide where to focus your research. 

### Budget


In general, if your budget is under $10,000 then SaaS is most likely for you. Some exceptions? Sure:
- You are a talented web programmer. 
- Your (brother, sister, friend, cousin) is a talented web programmer.
- You or your relative have enough time to devote to this endeavor. You will need a lot.

The fact is that custom websites are no longer appropriate for the average business owner with less than a $10k minimum start up cost, as well as an approximately $1k - $3k per month budget for ongoing improvements and maintenance. Fifteen years ago, there was a large open source community, and a lot of unemployed, jack of all trade programmers, looking to team up with the next "big idea" for a piece of the pie.

In today's world, droves of talented programmers are working for SaaS companies, building tools for you to use to build your own website. In fact, the SaaS offerings are so much better and so much more numerous, that building a custom site for the average small business makes little sense. 

If your budget is $10k or over, you are probably capable of funding a custom website. *However*, this alone should not rule out a SaaS website either. SaaS offerings come in many shapes and sizes, and many are fully capable of enterprise level websites!

### How does your business make money?

This of course is very important. A very important reason for deciding on a custom website could be that your business makes money in a way that is not well known or widely used. 
Most SaaS offerings are based on popular business / product templates. 

For example, do you sell clothing, DVD's, tools?  There are great SaaS offerings out there that can have your website up and running in less than a day. Do you provide a service that is based on multiple providers, working in different capacities and for different rates depending on the level of service provided?  You may need a custom application!  Get the idea?  The further from commonplace your products or services are, the more likely it is that you may need a custom application. 

Again, all of this advice is general, and there are exceptions to every rule. It may be that you can start with a SaaS offering, and customize it to fit your business model. In fact, that will most likely be the case for all SaaS choices. None of them will fit to a "tee", and you will have to add options, plugins and configure things in a way that conform to your business practices. And the SaaS offerings do a good job of offering a wide range of plugins and customizations to accommodate this.  

While SaaS sites do provide a great starting point, and a plethora of potential plugins, the flip side to that is that in many cases the plugins are supplied by 3rd parties. If you have problems with the plugin, you will need to deal with that provider, who may or may not have good relations with the main service provider. This can end up costing a lot of time and money, trying to make diverse systems work together. It may appear to be more "turn key" in the beginning, but end up costing more than if you created a custom site from the beginning. 

### What vendors does your company work with?

This area is sometimes overlooked when trying to decide on what type of website will be needed. For example, do you use a 3rd party to ship or fulfill your products? Do you sell your products on Amazon, Google stores, or other providers?  Do you use a vendor to provide your products to you?  Do you assemble the product after receiving parts from different vendors? Does your company use any software for customer management, accounting, or shipping? If you answer is yes to any of these questions, you need to know what platform each of those vendors or platforms use, and if it is compatible with the website you are planning to build. Almost all business done today involves the exchange of information between you, your customer, and your vendors.  That exchange of information usually takes place through an API, or Application Programming Interface. If you don't know what that means, and you own a business that is building a website, you better find out... and quickly. Here's a great explanation: [What is an API? In English, please](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-an-api-in-english-please-b880a3214a82/).

The point is that if you plan on doing any volume of business, at some point you will need to exchange information with one of these parties. If you have a thriving business, most likely it is already a requirement. Verifying that your "new" website is capable of exchanging information with already existing vendors is a big consideration for you to make BEFORE you build.  It would be like building a house without any provision for water, sewer or electricity. This is important stuff, and it can get very expensive to retrofit something that will be required!


### Is that all?

Absolutely not. There are endless considerations that can play into your decision. But you have heard the saying ["Analysis paralysis"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis)? If you have read through this post, you should have some good ideas now where to start. Add or remove considerations to suite you and your business. The most important takeaway from this is to first get a good idea of your needs, and document them, so that you can investigate the right things. Then, use that list to take note of which solutions fit your needs, and which do not. And who knows, you may start with a SaaS solution for a few years, and then when things are rolling and you have a better handle on what custom needs you have, migrate to a custom built site. There are no set rules. Don't read an ad for a website offering to find out you what you need in a website. Determine what you need in your website and *then* read the ads to see what product most closely fits those needs!
