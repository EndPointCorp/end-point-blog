Today, End Point is opening up the End Point AI Portal for our customers to use. As a technology consulting company that gets in the trenches with our customers to integrate, manage, and support the information technology they need to operate and transform their businesses, we believe this is a great service for us to provide.

**We are offering our AI Portal to our customers at no charge.** The price is certainly right, so we think our customers are very much going to want to use it. 🙂

### What’s in the Portal

End Point’s AI Portal provides an interface to interact with many different LLM AI chatbot services all in one place. It even gives users the ability to simultaneously submit queries and instructions to multiple LLMs and see their responses side by side.

Our Portal is a customized implementation of the [Open WebUI](https://openwebui.com/) AI interface and connects via APIs to various AI services. Because of this architecture, our analysis has shown that unless there is ongoing high-intensity usage, the cost per user will be very low — much lower than a typical end-user subscription to a single LLM provider. In the future we may implement an accounting system for the portal to pass usage costs onto our users, but our first priority is to get this capability into our clients’ hands as soon as possible to help them be early adopters of this transformative tech.

Our AI Portal connects to a range of proprietary AI-powered chatbots served up by Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and Grok, as well as to several open-source AI-powered chatbots hosted on servers in the United States. This includes the Deepseek R1 model developed in China that rocked the tech world with its release on January 20. It’s a remarkable model, but for businesses in the US having their chat histories stored on servers in China is generally not acceptable. Having the service hosted in the US helps address privacy concerns. We run the open-source models on our own servers and using third-party hosting providers such as [together.ai](https://www.together.ai) and [groq.com](https://groq.com).

To provide a more coherent user experience, the Open WebUI interface maintains each user’s chat history and provides the ability to manage, share, and download them.

The portal has already helped End Point with internal projects such as experimenting with how best to process various data sets to make them useful for AI-powered applications. The portal hosts several RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) applications that make use of various LLMs to search and answer questions about End Point’s blog posts—we are working to identify the best solution, so results may vary. Please don’t give up on reading our blog just yet.

We require users to accept our AI portal's standard Terms of Service to use the portal. Additionally, each AI-powered chatbot accessible through our portal has its own Terms of Service, to which we provide links for your reference. Our primary concern is whether the information users input into these chatbots might be used by providers for training or other purposes. We strive to avoid chatbots that engage in such practices, and as of the launch of our portal, we're not aware of any chatbot providers that claim rights to user input data. However, it’s common for Terms of Service documents to include clauses allowing providers to modify their terms without prior notice, so we can’t guarantee ongoing compliance with our standards. Regardless, users should always exercise caution and good judgment when entering confidential information into any online service.
