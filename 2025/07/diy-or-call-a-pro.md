### A Practical Guide for Business Owners

Many ecommerce businesses start with a scrappy DIY mindset. And that works — until it doesn’t. Knowing when to build it yourself and when to bring in a professional can mean the difference between momentum and mess.

We've worked with business owners who built their first site in a weekend — and others who sunk $50,000 into a platform they barely used. Here’s how to figure out which path fits your goals, skills, and budget.

### When to DIY (With Confidence)

There are plenty of situations where handling development yourself makes good business sense:

- **You're on a tight budget** and need proof-of-concept
- **You're using simple, user-friendly tools** like Shopify, Wix, or Squarespace
- **You just need a basic store or landing page**
- **You’re comfortable with tech** and enjoy learning new tools

#### Helpful DIY Tools

- Shopify
- Wordpress / WooCommerce (basic setup)
- Webflow
- Canva (for design)
- Zapier (for automation)

#### Watch Out For

- Mobile layout issues that won’t go away
- Slow site speeds or broken checkout processes
- Inventory or shipping errors you can’t fix

When the fixes start taking more time than they’re worth — or cost you sales — it’s time to reconsider.

### When to Hire a Developer or Consultancy

DIY stops making sense when your business starts scaling or when needs get technical. Here are common triggers:

- **You need custom integrations** — like with an inventory system (e.g., Art of Books), ERP, or POS
- **Site speed or UX are hurting conversions**
- **You’ve outgrown platform support** and need human help, fast
- **Your time is more valuable elsewhere**

#### Project Types Worth Hiring For

- Speed optimization
- Custom checkout flows
- APconnections (shipping, inventory, accounting)
- Multi-language or multi-country setups

#### Keep in mind there are additional facets to DIY

- Hosting — AWS, Azure, Linode
- DNS — Cloudflare
- Domains and SSL certificates

If these items are not known to you, consider talking to a consultant.

> **Pro Tip:** You don’t need to hire full-time. Start with project-based freelancers or small consultancies.
> Good consultancies will bill you on an hourly "as needed" basis. They should also provide estimates for projects that may exceed 5–10 hours.

### The Hybrid Approach: Best of Both Worlds

For many business owners, a blended model is ideal:

- **Have a pro build the foundation** — you manage content, products, and marketing.
- **Use no-code platforms** for updates, and freelancers for complex changes.
- **Set up clear roles** — who maintains what, and when to escalate.

### What It All Costs

| Type         | Typical Cost         | Best For                               |
|--------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| DIY          | $30–$300/month       | Simple stores, startups, testing ideas |
| Freelancer   | $500–$5,000/project  | Specific features or upgrades          |
| Consultancy  | $3,000–$50,000+      | Full builds, scaling projects, business plan integration, ongoing support |

> **Pro tip:** Always make sure you have *admin access*, version control (e.g., GitHub), ownership of code, and documentation if you hire.

### Conclusion: Know Your ROI

The right path depends on what gives you *momentum* without draining your *time* or *wallet*.

- Don’t hire someone just because you’re tired.
- Don’t DIY just because it’s cheap.

The smartest businesses find a rhythm — build what they can, hire when it matters, and stay focused on growth.

### Bonus: Quick Self-Assessment

Should you DIY or Hire?

- Do you have more time than budget right now?
- Are your tech skills good enough for the tools you’re using?
- Are bugs and delays costing you money or customers?
- Are you trying to integrate systems beyond your experience?

> If you answered *yes* to the first two → DIY may work.
> If you said *yes* to the last two → it’s time to bring in help.
