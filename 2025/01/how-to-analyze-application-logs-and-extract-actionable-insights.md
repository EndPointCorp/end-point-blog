### **1. Debugging Application Errors**

#### **What You Can Do**

When your application encounters errors, timely clarity is essential. The objectives here are to identify recurring issues, categorize errors by type, and isolate problematic scripts.

#### **How to Do It**

##### **1.1 Summarize Frequent Issues**

**Sample Log File:**

```plaintext
[2025-01-01 12:34:56] [client 192.168.1.1:12345] PHP Notice: Undefined variable $foo in /var/www/html/index.php on line 45 | referer: http://example.com/index.php
[2025-01-01 12:34:57] [client 192.168.1.1:12345] PHP Notice: Undefined variable $foo in /var/www/html/index.php on line 45 | referer: http://example.com/index.php
[2025-01-01 12:35:00] [client 10.0.0.2:6789] PHP Warning: Division by zero in /var/www/html/script.php on line 23 | referer: http://example.com/script.php
[2025-01-01 12:35:01] [client 10.0.0.2:6789] PHP Warning: Division by zero in /var/www/html/script.php on line 23 | referer: http://example.com/script.php
[2025-01-01 12:36:10] [client 192.168.1.1:12345] PHP Fatal error: Call to undefined function baz() in /var/www/html/lib.php on line 78 | referer: http://example.com/index.php
[2025-01-01 12:36:11] [client 172.16.0.5:54321] PHP Fatal error: Call to undefined function baz() in /var/www/html/lib.php on line 78 | referer: http://example.com/index.php
```

**Example Command:**

```bash
sed -E 's/^\[.*?\] //' error.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > summarized_errors.txt
```

**Explanation:**

- `sed -E 's/^\[.*?\] //' error.log`: Removes the timestamp and client information at the start of each line using a non-greedy regex.
- `sort`: Sorts the lines alphabetically.
- `uniq -c`: Counts the occurrences of each unique line.
- `sort -nr`: Sorts the counts in descending numerical order.
- `> summarized_errors.txt`: Redirects the output to `summarized_errors.txt`.

**Output (`summarized_errors.txt`):**

```plaintext
2 PHP Notice: Undefined variable $foo in /var/www/html/index.php on line 45 | referer: http://example.com/index.php
2 PHP Warning: Division by zero in /var/www/html/script.php on line 23 | referer: http://example.com/script.php
2 PHP Fatal error: Call to undefined function baz() in /var/www/html/lib.php on line 78 | referer: http://example.com/index.php
```

**Use Case:** Quickly prioritize fixes by identifying the most frequent errors.

##### **1.2 Categorize Errors by Type**

**Example Command:**

```bash
grep -oP 'PHP \K[^:]*' error.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > error_types.txt
```

**Explanation:**

- `grep -oP 'PHP \K[^:]*' error.log`: Extracts the error type (e.g., Notice, Warning, Fatal error) using Perl-compatible regex.
- `sort`: Sorts the extracted error types.
- `uniq -c`: Counts each error type's occurrences.
- `sort -nr`: Sorts the counts in descending order.
- `> error_types.txt`: Redirects the output to `error_types.txt`.

**Output (`error_types.txt`):**

```plaintext
2 Notice
2 Warning
2 Fatal error
```

**Use Case:** Determine which error types are most prevalent to address critical issues promptly.

---

##### **1.3 Focus on Problematic Scripts**

**Example Command:**

```bash
awk -F'in ' '{print $2}' error.log | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > script_error_frequency.txt
```

**Explanation:**

- `awk -F'in ' '{print $2}' error.log`: Extracts the file path and line number after "in ".
- `awk '{print $1}'`: Isolates the file path, removing the line number.
- `sort`: Sorts the script paths.
- `uniq -c`: Counts occurrences of each script.
- `sort -nr`: Sorts the counts in descending order.
- `> script_error_frequency.txt`: Redirects the output to `script_error_frequency.txt`.

**Output (`script_error_frequency.txt`):**

```plaintext
2 /var/www/html/index.php
2 /var/www/html/script.php
2 /var/www/html/lib.php
```

**Use Case:** Identify which scripts are generating the most errors to focus your debugging efforts effectively.

[2025-01-01 12:35:00] [client 10.0.0.2:6789] PHP Warning: Division by zero
[2025-01-01 12:36:10] [client 192.168.1.1:12345] PHP Fatal error: Call to undefined function
```

**Example Command:**

```bash
awk -F'\[client ' '{print $2}' error.log | awk -F':' '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > ip_frequency.txt
```

**Explanation:**

- `awk -F'\[client ' '{print $2}' error.log`: Extracts the IP address and port after `[client `.
- `awk -F':' '{print $1}'`: Removes the port, isolating the IP address.
- `sort | uniq -c | sort -nr`: Counts and sorts the IP addresses by frequency.
- `> ip_frequency.txt`: Redirects the output to `ip_frequency.txt`.

**Output (`ip_frequency.txt`):**

```plaintext
3 192.168.1.1
2 10.0.0.2
1 172.16.0.5
```

**Use Case:** Detect suspicious or misbehaving clients by identifying IPs generating the most errors.

##### **2.2 Spot High-Error Time Periods**

**Example Command:**

```bash
awk -F'[][]' '{split($2, time, ":"); print $1, time[1]":"time[2]":00"}' error.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > error_times.txt
```

**Explanation:**

- `-F'[][]'`: Uses square brackets as delimiters to extract the timestamp.
- `split($2, time, ":")`: Splits the timestamp into components.
- `print $1, time[1]":"time[2]":00"`: Formats the date and time up to minutes, normalizing seconds.
- `sort | uniq -c | sort -nr`: Counts and sorts the time periods by error frequency.
- `> error_times.txt`: Redirects the output to `error_times.txt`.

**Output (`error_times.txt`):**

```plaintext
2 2025-01-01 12:34:00
2 2025-01-01 12:35:00
2 2025-01-01 12:36:00
```

**Use Case:** Identify spikes in errors to correlate with deployments or traffic surges.

##### **2.3 Analyze IP-Referer Combinations**

**Example Command:**

```bash
grep "referer:" error.log | awk -F'\[client ' '{print $2}' | awk -F':| referer: ' '{print $1, $3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > ip_referer_combinations.txt
```

**Explanation:**

- `grep "referer:" error.log`: Filters lines containing the `referer` field.
- `awk -F'\[client ' '{print $2}'`: Extracts the IP and referer section.
- `awk -F':| referer: ' '{print $1, $3}'`: Separates the IP address from the referer URL.
- `sort | uniq -c | sort -nr`: Counts and sorts the IP-referer pairs by frequency.
- `> ip_referer_combinations.txt`: Redirects the output to `ip_referer_combinations.txt`.

**Output (`ip_referer_combinations.txt`):**

```plaintext
2 192.168.1.1 http://example.com/index.php
2 10.0.0.2 http://example.com/script.php
1 172.16.0.5 http://example.com/index.php
```

**Use Case:** Uncover patterns of malicious traffic by linking IP addresses to specific referer URLs.
