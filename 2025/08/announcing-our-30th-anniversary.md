Today marks End Point's 30th anniversary!

On this date in 1995, as the Internet boom was just beginning, [Rick Peltzman](/team/rick-peltzman/) and I started the company, diving into the new and fast-changing world of the web. Since then, End Point has worked with a wide range of clients, tackled complex challenges, built reliable, long-term solutions, and adapted to continual waves of technological change — most recently integrating AI technologies into our work. The dedication and talent of our team have made all the difference.

As we reflect on these 30 years, we’re grateful for the many clients, partners, and colleagues who have been part of our story. We look forward to continuing to learn, innovate, and create in the years ahead.
