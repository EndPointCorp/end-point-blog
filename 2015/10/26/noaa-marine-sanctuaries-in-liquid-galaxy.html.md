End Point enjoys a strong presence in the aquarium and museum community with our ability to deploy the Liquid Galaxy display platform. Our content team recently embedded 14 graphic overlays in the [Aquarium of the Pacific](http://www.aquariumofpacific.org/) and [Monterrey Bay National Marine Sanctuary](https://montereybay.noaa.gov/) Liquid Galaxy systems. These layers highlight National Marine Sanctuary PDF [maps](https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/about/maps.html) created by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The Office of National Marine Sanctuaries serves as the trustee for a network of 14 protected areas encompassing more than 170,000 square miles from American Samoa to the Florida Keys. As marine sanctuaries, however, these locations are not gong to see as many humans as Yosemite or Yellowstone. Embedding the maps on the Liquid Galaxy allows viewers to dynamically explore the marine sanctuary map and its relationship to the larger landscape in Google Earth, and brings these remote locations to many more interactions with the public.

We are happy to share some of the media that goes into these presentations: A short YouTube video featuring the Marine sanctuary overlays in Google Earth is [here](http://goo.gl/VfQccK). If you would like to explore the marine sanctuaries overlays on your desktop in Google Earth, the .kmz files are hosted with Google Drive [here](http://goo.gl/Ku6zik).
