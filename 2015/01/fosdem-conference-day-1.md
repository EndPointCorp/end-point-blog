It’s my first day of my first time at [FOSDEM](https://archive.fosdem.org/2015/) and I really loved it. There’s simply no other way to put it.

I guess that the main difference with other conferences is the incredibly *huge and diverse amount of topics* and talks that you can attend in a short amount of time (two days).

While there’s all this choice you won’t be able to attend all of them, so you have to pick the one which interests you more. Being a SysAdmin/DevOps person I was more geared toward these kind of talks and I found plenty!

Most of the talks were revolving around “the cloud”, how to manage it, best practices and other similar aspects.

Now even if you don’t happen to be a huge cloud infrastructure fan *there’s always good content* to squeeze out of these incredibly skilled people and how each of them tackled and overcame their own set of problems.

I was particularly impressed by a few talks, namely the one about **[OpenLISP](http://www.openlisp.org/)** by Luigi Iannone which explained with good detail and extremely clearly some parts of this new complex geographically location-independent routing protocol. Amazing and what a perfect time for such a nifty tool now that (maybe) finally IPv6 will start to be more widely used.

Then there was also the **[GlusterFS](http://www.gluster.org/)**-centric talk from Niels de Vos which again was very helpful in having a good primer about this grat technology tool which I’ll soon use in one of our internal experiments.

I also attended really good technical talks about **[Apache Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/)** (Dave Lester), **infrastructure management with [Juju](https://juju.ubuntu.com/)** (Charles Butler), which were all good starting point to have an initial idea on these technologies or approach for people who could have never dealt with them before.

On the other end of the spectrum there also also some more abstract interesting ones which gave interesting ideas to start evaluating different high level approaches like the **Consuming and contributing to open source infrastructure mangement code** (Spencer Krum) one or the **[IAAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Infrastructure_as_a_service_.28IaaS.29) Beyond Infrastructure** (Flavio Percoco).

All the talks I attended too were great and well organized, at least if you can bear with a *huge flow of people* moving around and squeezing you here and there because with all these good topics it’s easy to imagine how many people were attracted here.

All in all a really great experience all around and it’s not yet finished.

So now back to bed early as tomorrow there’s another long list of interesting topics I’ll try to chase during day 2.
