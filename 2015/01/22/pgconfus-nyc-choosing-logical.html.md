title: 'PGConf.US NYC: "Choosing a Logical Replication System"'
---

I'm excited to have my talk "Choosing a Logical Replication System" accepted to PGConf.US!  I'll be speaking on Friday, March 27th from 2:00 - 2:50, as part of the Strategy track.

In this talk I will cover a variety of existing Logical Replication systems for PostgreSQL and go over some of the differences between requirements, supported capabilities, and why you might choose one system over another.  I'll also cover some of the changes in PostgreSQL 9.4.

Read about the talk [here](http://www.pgconf.us/2015/event/96/).
