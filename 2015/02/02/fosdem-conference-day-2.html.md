It’s Sunday evening, the [2015 FOSDEM conference](https://fosdem.org/2015/) is over, so it’s time to give my impressions and opinions.

As I already said in my [day 1 blog](/blog/2015/01/31/fosdem-conference-day-1) post, I really enjoyed the conference as I usually do in this kind of open source, enthusiast, knowledge sharing conference.

Now that’s also where the FOSDEM somehow slightly disappointed me: I lived it as yet another conference with a series of talks and some nice ideas here and there.

When I heard about the FOSDEM I always heard about a developer-centric conference so my first natural conclusion was that there probably would have been a lot of cooperative hand-on coding, some pair programming, huge hackathon rooms and so on. Unfortunately this wasn’t the case, from what I could see.

Don’t get me wrong: I **really loved all the talks** I attended and really appreciated all the input I had, which is awesome.

But as you may know when expectations fall short you always remain with a little bit of bitter taste wandering inside you.

That said I really loved the talks about *[KVM](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page) Observability* from Stefan Hajnoczi which provided me a lot of interesting hints and tools I could use straight away when coming back at work and the *NUMA architecture in [oVirt](https://www.ovirt.org/)* from Doron Fediuck which gave an incredibly useful and clear introduction to NUMA systems.

I was also really interested to hear about the latest news on the *[CentOS](https://www.centos.org/) SIGs* project and what we could expect there in the future.

The nice aspect of this kind of conference is that you happen to know a lot of incredibly talented people which would be difficult to meet otherwise. As an example I was lucky enough to talk with *Luca Gibelli* which is one of the main initial contributors of *ClamAV*, who has since moved on to other interesting projects.

For next year I’d really love to see some more space dedicated encourage real hand-on programming like help request/proposals zone where FOSDEM visitor could meet and work together, create and enjoy the marvelous joys of pair programming.

I really want to thank all the volunteers and speakers that made the FOSDEM possible. It was a really great experience and I’ll definitely try to be here again in future!
