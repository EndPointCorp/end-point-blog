The 2015 [Perl Dancer Conference](https://www.perl.dance) has recently released the presentation videos. This year the conference was hosted in beautiful Vienna, Austria. Josh Lavin and I were both honored to attend the conference as well as give talks. Earlier, Josh wrote summaries of the conference:

I gave a talk exploring new technologies for End Point’s own [DevCamps](http://devcamps.org) development tool. During the presentation I detailed my research into containers and what a cloud-based development environment might look like.

### Summary

The Perl Dancer community continues to flourish and the conference this year hosted a record 5 core [Dancer](http://perldancer.org) developers. Dancer is about to release the finalized version of its long awaited plugin infrastructure for [Dancer2](https://github.com/PerlDancer/Dancer2). A lot of work on this was completed during the conference. Being an organizer of the conference, it brings me great joy to see this success. This news along with the release of Perl 6, I am certain 2016 will be a wonderful year for not only Dancer but the entire [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) community.
