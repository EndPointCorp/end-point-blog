title: RailsConf 2015 for the non-Attendee

This blog post is really for myself. Because I had the unique experience of [bringing a baby to a conference](/blog/2015/04/27/how-to-bring-baby-to-tech-conference), I made an extra effort to talk to other attendees about what sessions shouldn’t be missed. Here are the top takeaways from the conference that I recommend (in no particular order):

- [Watch DHH’s Keynote](http://confreaks.tv/videos/railsconf2015-opening-keynote)
- ... and [Aaron Patterson Keynote](http://confreaks.tv/videos/railsconf2015-keynote-day-2-opening)
- [Watch Kent Beck’s Keynote](http://confreaks.tv/videos/railsconf2015-closing-keynote)
- [Amelia Bedelia Learns to Code](http://confreaks.tv/videos/railsconf2015-amelia-bedelia-learns-to-code), by [Kylie Stradley](https://twitter.com/kyfast), was a popular talk from day 1. Video link forthcoming.
- Watch [Shipping Ruby Apps with Docker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVN7aTqr550) by Bryan Helmkamp. This video was strongly recommended before jumping into Docker, which was a trendy topic in dev-ops talks.
- Watch [Justin Searls’](https://twitter.com/searls) talk [Sometimes a Controller is Just a Controller](http://confreaks.tv/videos/railsconf2015-sometimes-a-controller-is-just-a-controller).
- Watch [Sandi Metz’s](https://twitter.com/sandimetz) talk [Nothing is Something](http://confreaks.tv/videos/railsconf2015-nothing-is-something).
- Read [this book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things) by Don Norman if you care about UX. [Joe Mastey](https://twitter.com/jmmastey) recommended it in his talk, [Bringing UX to Your Code](http://confreaks.tv/videos/railsconf2015-bringing-ux-to-your-code).
- [Yehuda Katz](https://twitter.com/wycats) & [Tom Dale’s](https://twitter.com/tomdale) talk, [How Rust Helped us Write Better Ruby](http://confreaks.tv/videos/railsconf2015-bending-the-curve-how-rust-helped-us-write-better-ruby) was standing room only. Video link forthcoming. Also check out [their fireside chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0B9XjwoaCNM) on [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com/).
- [Riding Rails for 10 Years](http://confreaks.tv/videos/railsconf2015-riding-rails-for-10-years) by [John Duff](https://twitter.com/johnduff) gives a great history of the evolution of Rails in the Shopify codebase.

Right now, the videos are all unedited from the [Confreaks](http://www.confreaks.com/) live stream of the keynote/main room, and I’ll update as the remaining videos become available.

### A Message From the Sponsors

**My husband:** My conferences never have giveaways that cool.

**Me:** That’s because you work in academia.

You can read the full list of sponsors [here](https://railsconf.com/2015/sponsors), but I wanted to comment further:

[Hired](https://hired.com/) was the diamond sponsor this year and they ran a ping pong tournament. The winner received $2000, and runners up received $1000, $500, $250. The final match was heavily attended and competitive! Practice up for next year?

[Engine Yard](https://www.engineyard.com/) also put on a really fun scavenger hunt using [Scavify](https://www.scavify.com/). Since I couldn’t attend the multiple parties going on at night, this was a really fun way to participate and socialize.
