Next week, I'm headed to my 6th [RailsConf 2015](http://railsconf.com/) in Atlanta, with the whole family in tow:

The gang. Note: Dogs will not be attending conference.

This will be a new experience since my husband will be juggling two kids while I attend the daily sessions. So it makes sense going into the conference fairly organized to aid in the kid juggling, right? So I've picked out a few sessions that I'm looking forward to attending. Here they are:

- [Don't be a Hero: Sustainable Open Source](http://railsconf.com/program#prop_1032)
- [Riding Rails for 10 Years](http://railsconf.com/program#prop_1018)

- [Microservices: A Bittersweet Symphony](http://railsconf.com/program#prop_955)
- [SVG Charts and Graphics with Ruby](http://railsconf.com/program#prop_1057)
- [Building RailsPerf: A Toolkit to Detect Performance Regressions in Ruby on Rails Core](http://railsconf.com/program#prop_1087)
- [High Performance APIs in Ruby Using ActiveRecord and Goliath](http://railsconf.com/program#prop_1251)
- [What Comes After MVC](http://railsconf.com/program#prop_1132)
- [Your Front End Framework is Overkill - Server Side JavaScript with Rails](http://railsconf.com/program#prop_999)

RailsConf is a multi-track conference, with tracks including Distributed Systems, Culture, Growing Talent, Testing, APIs, Front End, Crafting Code, JavaScript, and Data & Analytics. There are also Beginner and Lab tracks, which might be suitable to those looking for a learning & training oriented experience. As you might be able to tell, the sessions I'm interested in cover a mix of performance, open source, and front-end dev. As I've become a more experienced Rails developer, RailsConf has been more about seeing what's going on in the Rails community and what the future holds, and less about the technical nitty-gritty or training sessions.

Stay tuned for a handful of blog posts from the conference!
