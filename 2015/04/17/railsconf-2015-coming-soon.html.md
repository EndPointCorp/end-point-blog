Next week, I’m headed to my 6th [RailsConf](https://railsconf.com/2015/) in Atlanta, with the whole family in tow:

The gang. Note: Dogs will not be attending conference.

This will be a new experience since my husband will be juggling two kids while I attend the daily sessions. So it makes sense going into the conference fairly organized to aid in the kid juggling, right? So I’ve picked out a few sessions that I’m looking forward to attending. Here they are:

RailsConf is a multi-track conference, with tracks including Distributed Systems, Culture, Growing Talent, Testing, APIs, Front End, Crafting Code, JavaScript, and Data & Analytics. There are also Beginner and Lab tracks, which might be suitable to those looking for a learning & training oriented experience. As you might be able to tell, the sessions I’m interested in cover a mix of performance, open source, and front-end dev. As I’ve become a more experienced Rails developer, RailsConf has been more about seeing what’s going on in the Rails community and what the future holds, and less about the technical nitty-gritty or training sessions.

Stay tuned for a handful of blog posts from the conference!
