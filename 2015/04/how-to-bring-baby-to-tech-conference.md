Last week, I brought my 4 month old to [RailsConf](https://railsconf.com/2015/). In a game-day decision, rather than drag a two year old and husband along on the ~5 hour drive and send the dogs to boarding, we decided it would ultimately be easier on everyone (except maybe me) if I attended the conference with the baby, especially since a good amount of the conference would be live-streamed.

Daily morning photos at the conference.

While I was there, I was asked often how it was bringing a baby to a conference, so I decided to write a blog post. As with all parenting advice, the circumstances are a strong factor in how the experience turned out. RailsConf is a casual three-day multi-track tech conference with many breaks and social events—​it’s as much about socialization as it is about technical know-how. This is not my first baby and not my first time at RailsConf, so I had some idea of what I might be getting into. Minus a few minor squeaks, baby Skardal was sleeping or sitting happily throughout the conference.

Here’s what I [qualitatively] perceived to be the reaction of others attending the conference to baby Skardal:

In list form:

- **Didn’t Notice:** Probably about 50% didn’t notice I had a baby, especially when she was sleeping soundly in the carrier.
- **Stares:** Around 50% may have stared. See below for more.
- **Joke:** A really small percentage of people made some variation of the joke “Starting her early, eh?”
- **Conversation:** An equally small percentage of people started a conversation with me, which often led to more technical talk.

Here are some reasons I imagined behind the staring:

- That baby is very cute (I’m not biased at all!)
- Shock
- Wonder if day care is provided (No, it wasn’t. But with a 4 month old who hasn’t been in day care yet, I probably wouldn’t have used it.)
- Too hungover to politely not stare

### Pros & Cons

And here is how I felt after the conference, regarding pros and cons on bringing the baby:

<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr> <td style="padding-right:10px;" valign="top" width="50%"><b>Pros</b><br/>
<ul><li>A baby is a good conversation starter, which is beneficial in a generally introverted crowd.</li>
<li>I realized there are helpful & nice people in the world who offered to help plenty of times.</li>
<li>The baby was happiest staying with me.</li>
</ul></td> <td style="padding-left:10px;" valign="top" width="50%"><b>Cons</b><br/>
<ul><li>Because children were the focus of many conversations, I missed out on talking shop a bit.</li>
<li>It’s tiring, but in the same way that all parenting is.</li>
<li>I couldn’t participate in all of the social/evening activities of the conference.</li>
<li>Staring generally makes me feel uncomfortable.</li>
</ul></td> </tr>
</tbody></table>

### Tips

And finally, some tips:

- Plan ahead:
    - Review the sessions in advance and pick out ones you want to attend because you may not have time to do that on the fly.
    - Walk (or travel) the route from your hotel to the conference so you know how long it will take and if there will be challenges.
- Be agile and adapt. Most parents are already probably doing this with a 4 month old.
- Manage your expectations:
    - Expect the conference with a baby to be tiring & challenging at times.
    - Expect stares.
    - Expect you won’t make it to every session you want, so make a point of talking to others to find out their favorite sessions.
- If not provided, ask conference organizers for access to a nursing or stashing room.
- Bring baby gear options: carrier, stroller, bouncy seat, etc.
- Research food delivery options ahead of time.
- Order foods that are easy to eat with one hand. Again, another skill parents of a 4 month old may have developed.
- Sit or stand in the back of talks.

While in these circumstances I think we made the right decision, I look forward to attending more conferences sans-children.
