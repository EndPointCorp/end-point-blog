End Point's Ethan Rowe is a staunch believer that good data management is good business and serves as the company's foremost expert in VPN development.

Since joining End Point last summer, Ethan has worked extensively using Interchange and in database development. His database skills are greatly enhanced by his understanding of business logic and how effective databases can make a positive impact on business results. Says Ethan, "If the data is structured correctly, resulting from a detailed analysis of the types of information you need, what you want to do with that information, etc., then the data will serve you properly over the long term."

Because businesses need to be able to adapt to various market pressures and growth opportunities, the way they use their data often changes. For instance, in inventory control, a database with an effective logic regime can be used by many different applications in many different functional departments and always have reliable inventory numbers to work with. The key is to create the logic within the database once, and then it doesn't need to be re-created with every application running on top of it.

Beyond databases, Ethan recently found an innovative virtual private network (VPN) solution to give End Point client Arkansas Valley Feather Co. secure remote access to network functions for employees working from home or on the road. Implementation was complicated by the fact that the company's users were spread out over many platforms (multiple versions of Windows, Linux, and Mac OS) and many different geographic locations. Using OpenVPN and the OpenBSD operating system, Ethan helped the Arkansas Valley Feather Co. establish safe, effective network access for its off-site employees.

Ethan is based in Boston, where he's an accomplished pianist and a Hartford Marathon finisher. As a 14-year-old ski racer, he beat current overall World Cup champion Bode Miller on a number of occasions. He might not fare as well now, but then we'd like to see what Bode Miller would do when faced with business-critical PostgreSQL complications.
