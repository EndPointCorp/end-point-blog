title: End Point’s New HQ
---

We’ve moved! To help accommodate our company’s growth and progress, we’ve moved our headquarters to roomier offices in Manhattan’s Flatiron District at 920 Broadway.

The new office provides End Point with a congenial meeting space as well as state-of-the-art work facilities for the engineers and other personnel working there. It also provides End Point with room for expansion that addresses the company’s intent to hire additional developers in the New York area.

Our new full address is End Point Corporation, 920 Broadway Suite 701, New York, NY 10010. Our phone number remains (212) 929-6923.
