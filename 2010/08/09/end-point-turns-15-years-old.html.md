title: End Point turns 15 years old
---

End Point was founded on August 8, 1995, so yesterday was its 15th anniversary! (Or is it a birthday? I’m never sure which it is for a company.) End Point’s founders Rick Peltzman and Ben Goldstein have been friends since grade school, and this wasn’t the first business they started together—​in college they painted houses together.

Nearly 20 years later, sensing the huge potential of the newly commercialized Internet as a medium for mass communications and commerce, they joined forces again. They founded End Point to offer Internet and ecommerce consulting and hosting services. That was back before the Internet became heavily hyped, before the tech bubble of the late ’90s, and like most new companies, it took a lot of hard work, hope, patience, skill, and a little luck.

End Point has grown from those humble beginnings to our present staff of 21 employees located in 13 states. We work with wonderful clients, old and new, who in many cases have become very close partners and friends as we’ve worked together to grow their businesses over the years.

If we worked together in one office, we’d certainly celebrate with a large birthday cake, but since we’re a distributed company, we’re celebrating by each of us going out to a movie with family or friends, and having pizza or ice cream afterwards. It’s not quite the same as being in the same room, but I don’t think anyone will miss singing the “happy birthday” song and I suspect we’ll all somehow manage to enjoy ourselves anyway.

Thanks to everyone who has made End Point what it is—​our employees, our clients, our families, and our friends in the industry and everywhere. We’re looking forward to many more enjoyable years.
