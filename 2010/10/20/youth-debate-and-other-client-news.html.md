I want to draw attention to several of our clients who have been in the news lately:

The [Youth Debate](http://youthdebate.org/) 2010 site is live and currently accepting question submissions from youth interested in hearing video responses from the DNC & RNC chairmen before the November midterm elections. It's a simple site, developed and deployed quickly with an eye toward handling a very high amount traffic over a short period of time. We're excited to see what questions and answers come out of the project.

Jared Loftus, entrepreneur and owner of The College District, was profiled in a recent [BusinessReport.com article about his business](http://www.businessreport.com/news/2010/oct/18/entrepreneur-jared-loftus-gnit1/). We've written about Jared's business and some of the technical details underpinning his sites in past blog posts, including one upon [launch of 4 additional sites](http://blog.endpoint.com/2009/01/college-district-launches-4-additional.html) and one [comparing College District multi-site architecture to Spree](http://blog.endpoint.com/2010/05/spree-multi-store-architecture.html).

Our client FLOR.com is a well-known retail modular carpet seller and a division of the public company Interface, Inc. We've been pleased to work with them to add new features to and support the operations of their ecommerce system for the past 3 years. Interface's founder, Ray Anderson, has been on a mission to reduce negative environmental impact made during their manufacturing process. He published a book, [Confessions of a Radical Industrialist](http://us.macmillan.com/confessionsofaradicalindustrialist), and has been speaking about it and opening eyes to the possibilities for improvement.

We're always happy to see our clients doing interesting things and getting the attention they deserve!
