Time for another installment of Monday Reading Material!

I’m in New Zealand (and across the dateline!) so this is appearing a day early for many of you :)

Reading material from last week:

- [The power of ‘random](https://web.archive.org/web/20100308223508/http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/network-coding-part1.html)’. *Work done with routers to combine messages (improve efficiency of transport) and then forward them *at random* on to another hop. Turned out this was better overall than trying to selectively forward to "most likely" next hops.*

- [A Perl Programming maintenance checklist](http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2010/02/a-perl-programming-maintenance-checklist.html). *Things you can do to make your code maintainable (in any language!)*

- [Mozilla Weave](https://arstechnica.com/open-source/reviews/2010/02/mozilla-weave-10-take-your-tabs-and-bookmarks-everywhere.ars). *Bookmark sync!*

- [How much energy How do I find out how much electricity something uses?](http://michaelbluejay.com/electricity/howmuch.html). *Great article on figuring this out. I have a [kill a watt](http://www.p3international.com/products/p4400.html) and need to investigate a few appliances I have at home*.
