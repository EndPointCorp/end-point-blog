Just a few links from the past week that are worth checking out: 

- “Spices: the internet of the ancient world!” — [Planet Money Podcast](https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2010/02/podcast_spice_economics.html?ft=1&f=93559255). Great storytelling about the ancient spice trade and how information about where certain spices came from eventually leaked out and popped the spice trading bubble/monopoly.

- [Enterprise software is entirely bereft of soul](https://dealarchitect.typepad.com/deal_architect/2010/02/enterprise-software-is-entirely-bereft-of-soul.html). Reading this reminded me of [antifeatures](https://www.fsf.org/bulletin/2007/fall/antifeatures/) and the competitive advantages of open source software.

- [Emulating Empathy](https://steveblank.com/2010/02/08/emulating-empathy/). Nice summary of how interacting with users of software (customers) on a non-technical issues, or over high-level requirements, provokes creativity. Also, that good customer communication is a *skill* not an innate talent—​meaning it can be taught and learned. :)

- [Interaxon](https://choosemuse.com/). Other than the cute name, this is a fascinating company and concept based in Vancouver, BC. Thought controlled computing! Looking forward to seeing what comes out of their “Bright Ideas” exhibit during the Winter Olympics.
