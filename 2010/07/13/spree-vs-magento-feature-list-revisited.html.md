title: 'Spree vs. Magento: Feature List Revisited'
---

A little over a month ago, I wrote an article on [Spree vs. Magento Features](http://blog.endpoint.com/2010/06/spree-vs-magento-feature-list.html). Recently, a client asked me to describe the features mentioned in that article. I thought this was another great opportunity to expand on my response to the client. So, here I am, revisiting ecommerce features in Spree and Magento. The [original article](http://blog.endpoint.com/2010/06/spree-vs-magento-feature-list.html) can be referenced to compare availability of these features in Spree and Magento.

### Features on a Single Product or Group of Product

- **Product reviews and/or ratings**: functionality to allow customers to review and rate products. See [a Backcountry.com product page](http://www.backcountry.com/outdoorgear/TNF0115/The-North-Face-Denali-Fleece-Jacket-Mens.html#reviews) for an example.
- **Product QnA**: functionality allow customers to ask and answer questions on products. See [a Backcountry.com product page](http://www.backcountry.com/outdoorgear/TNF0115/The-North-Face-Denali-Fleece-Jacket-Mens.html#qanda) for an example.
- **Product SEO (URL, title, meta data control)**: functionality to allow site administrators to manage product URLs, product page titles, and product meta data.
- **Advanced/flexible taxonomy**: functionality to build a custom taxonomy / navigation structure for product browsing. For example, build multiple categories and subcategories with complex hierarchy. The taxonomy at [Spree's demo](http://demo.spreecommerce.com/) includes two categories of brand and category and subcategories in each.
- **SEO for taxonomy pages**: functionality to allow site administrators to manage taxonomy URLs, taxonomy page titles, and taxonomy meta data.
- **Configurable product search**: functionality to allow the developers and site administrators to adjust parameters used in search, such as products to show per page, and to show products with no on hand stock.
- **Bundled products for discount**: functionality to allow site administrators to create bundles or group products together and then apply a discount to the entire bundle. For example, product X, Y and Z purchased together will yield a $10.00 discount.
- **Recently viewed products**:  functionality to show customers products they recently visited. This can be displayed on other product pages or the navigation pages to aid in navigation back to those products if the user would like to revisit the products. See the image below for an example of this functionality in action at [Paper Source](http://www.paper-source.com/).

<a href="/blog/2010/07/13/spree-vs-magento-feature-list-revisited/image-0-big.png" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5493450761146669666" src="/blog/2010/07/13/spree-vs-magento-feature-list-revisited/image-0.png" style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 333px;"/></a>

- **Upsell**: functionality to encourage the customer to purchase a similar product from a higher price point, or to purchase an add on, may or may not include the functionality to allow site administrators to manage the upsell products.
- **Cross sell**: functionality to encourage the customer to purchase related items, may or may not include the functionality to allow site administrators to manage the cross sell products.

[steepandcheap.com](http://www.steepandcheap.com/) offers a RSS feed, however, they are unique in that they offer a one deal at a time business model, so the RSS feed contains a stream of products for sale. This may or may not include the functionality to allow site administrators to manage the RSS feed contents.

- **Send product email to friend**: functionality to allow customers to send emails to their friend to visit a specific product.
- **Product tagging / search by tagging**: functionality to allow site administrators to assign tags to products for navigation or searching. See [CityPass's blog](http://www.citypass.com/blog/) for an example of tag use in a content management system; in ecommerce context, the tags would navigate to a set of products instead of a set of blog articles.
- **Breadcrumbs**: functionality that renders the product navigation hierarchy on navigation and product pages to allow customers to navigate to previous pages visited. See [a Spree demo navigation page](http://demo.spreecommerce.com/t/brands/ruby-on-rails) for an example.
