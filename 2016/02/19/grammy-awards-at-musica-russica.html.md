I was excited to learn this week about a Grammy Award recently awarded in connection with one of End Point’s valued customers, Musica Russica. [Musica Russica](http://www.musicarussica.com/) is a specialized e-commerce website selling Russian choral sheet music as well as choral music recordings.

Last week’s Grammy-Award-winning (Best Choral Performance) recording by the Kansas City/Phoenix Chorales, conducted by Charles Bruffy, is featured at Musica Russica. Take a moment and listen to samples of [Rachmaninoff's All-Night Vigil](https://web.archive.org/web/20160312111456/http://www.musicarussica.com/compact_discs/a136).

This is the third Grammy award for best choral recordings won with music published by Musica Russica, adding to their awards from 2007 and 2015.

Musica Russica is the largest publisher of Russian choral music outside of Russia. Musica Russica’s business is built on a large collection of choral music which the founder, Dr. Vladimir Morosan, collected in his home country. Vladimir was passionate about this historical music and was concerned that it would not be properly preserved. In the 1980s he collected sheet music from libraries and churches in the former Soviet Union bringing the collection to the United States.

Not only did Vladimir collect music and develop a business to distribute it to music lovers around the world, he has also spent a career directing choirs to sing the music he loves. Vladimir is the founder and director of the [Archangel Voices](http://www.archangelvoices.com/) ensemble. On the Musica Russica website, you can purchase CDs or MP3s of recorded music. For much of the music, you can find the underlying sheet music on the website as well.

End Point has worked with Musica Russica since 2012 when we built their custom e-commerce website with the Ruby on Rails framework. We developed an easy to use shopping cart and one page checkout for them as an open source project called [Piggybak](http://www.piggybak.org/).

End Point congratulates everyone at Musica Russica and all those involved with the Rachmaninoff's All-Night Vigil recording.
