[Trey McKay](http://treymckay.net) was kind enough to let me ask him a bunch of questions. Trey’s an Interaction Designer at [Shapeways](http://www.shapeways.com/), which is a global 3D printing service and marketplace.  

Trey focusses on designing and building experiences for turning 3D designs into 3D printed products. He’s worked on everything from site-wide navigation redesigns to a suite of 3D tools, which help product designers identify and fix potential issues in their designs before they go into manufacturing. If you want to stalk him on the internet, check out his [personal site](http://treymckay.net) or holler at him on the Twitter: @trey_mckay. 

I'll present this interview in two parts in order to avoid exhausting attention spans, thus improving the user experience of my readers.  

*Liz Flyntz: What is the thing that is most misunderstood about user interface and user experience design, in your opinion?*

Trey McKay: In general, I've noticed that a lot of folks think that the role of a designer is to "make something pretty." From coworkers to general public, I think there is a common misconception about what design is, how important it is, and what we as UX/UI designers do on the day-to-day. 

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/end-point-blog-git/2016/05/16/talking-ui-ux-treymckay-1/shapeways.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="/end-point-blog-git/2016/05/16/talking-ui-ux-treymckay-1/shapeways.jpg"/></a></div>

Design is how something works. Good design is transparent, as the saying goes, because when something is properly designed, it's not getting in the user's way. Well-designed products and services help people get stuff done, save them time, make their lives easier. We only notice design when it's not doing those things for us, when it's not helping us solve problems or is causing us frustration by being unclear, unhelpful, or distracting us from completing our tasks. 

Here’s an example: let's say as an interaction designer I'm working with a developer on a login form for the website. When I start to work on this page I add interface copy and spacing to UI elements to help clearly communicate what things do, what the user is expected to input. I group labels with their form field and work with color to make it clear what elements are clickable and what they need to interact with first.

Now the common reaction for someone looking at this interface again after I've worked on it is likely, "wow this looks a lot better" or something along those lines. I think this is where the "designers make things pretty" mentality comes from for the person who doesn't work with designers often or at all. But a good developer knows that a lot more is going on than simply making something look "pretty." They'll know that the login form is more understandable at first glance, easier to use to complete your task, and has copy that is more helpful. 

*LF: What are your must-have items of documentation?  Do you always make user/use cases and workflows, for instance?*

TM: For me personally, the most important and must-have item 100% of the time is a clear problem statement. i.e. "What is the user problem that we're solving here?" Once you have that clearly stated, and agreed upon, it becomes much easier to keep projects focused and design something useful. Usability testing, user research, focus groups and the like are excellent tools for truly understanding where users have problems in your experience, and why they're having them. Workflows are essential for making sure that a user can get from point A to point B without any unnecessary steps, without any pitfalls or dead-ends in the experience. It's important to get them sorted out as early into a project as possible, because if you end up focusing on details of a specific interface or step in the flow, without the flow itself figured out, then you may end up realizing later that the thing you spent all that time and energy on isn't necessary at all. That's a terrible feeling, trust me. 

*Thus concludes part 1 of a two-part interview!  Stay tuned for part 2, coming soon.*
