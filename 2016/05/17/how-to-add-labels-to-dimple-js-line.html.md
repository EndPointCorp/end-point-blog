title: How to Add Labels to a Dimple JS Line Chart
---

I was recently working on a project that was using [DimpleJS](http://dimplejs.org/), which the docs describe as “An object-oriented API for business analytics powered by d3”. I was using it to create a variety of graphs, some of which were line graphs. The client had requested that the line graph display the y-value of the line on the graph. This is easily accomplished with bar graphs in Dimple, however, not so easily done with line graphs.

I had spent some time Googling to find what others had done to add this functionality but could not find it anywhere. So, I read the [documentation](http://dimplejs.org/advanced_examples_viewer.html?id=advanced_custom_styling) where they add labels to a bar graph, and “tweaked” it like so:

```javascript
var s = myChart.addSeries(null, dimple.plot.line);
.
.
.
/*Add prices to line chart*/
s.afterDraw = function (shape, data) {
  // Get the shape as a d3 selection
  var s = d3.select(shape);
  var i = 0;
  _.forEach(data.points, function(point) {
    var rect = {
    x: parseFloat(point.x),
    y: parseFloat(point.y)
  };
  // Add a text label for the value
  if(data.markerData[i] != undefined) {
    svg.append("text")
    .attr("x", rect.x)
    .attr("y", rect.y - 10)
    // Centre align
    .style("text-anchor", "middle")
    .style("font-size", "10px")
    .style("font-family", "sans-serif")
    // Format the number
    .text(data.markerData[i].y);
  }
  i++
});
```

Some styling still needs to be done but you can see that the y-values are now placed on the line graph. We are using lodash on this project but if you do not want to use lodash, just replace the _.forEach (line 10)and this technique should just plug in for you.
