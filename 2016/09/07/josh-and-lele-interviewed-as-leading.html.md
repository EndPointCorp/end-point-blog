End Point’s Josh Williams and Lele Calò were recently interviewed for a piece that is now published on [Clutch](https://clutch.co/), a site offering B2B research and reviews. Josh and Lele were interviewed as experts in leading cloud technologies. The interview can be found [here](https://clutch.co/cloud/expert-interview/end-point).

Josh and Lele began the interview by giving some background on End Point and its various offerings. These offerings include software development, hosting, consulting, and the [Liquid Galaxy](https://liquidgalaxy.endpoint.com/) division.

Josh and Lele then answered questions regarding cloud technologies. These questions included technologies they work with, challenges that cloud technologies help companies overcome, and recommendation for companies moving toward cloud services. Recently, End Point has had customers using Amazon Web Services [AWS], Rackspace, OVH, Google Cloud, Linode, and DigitalOcean. Josh and Lele agree that cloud services are quite beneficial in dealing with usage profiles and load inconsistencies. Josh and Lele also agreed that when it comes to companies moving into cloud services, moving components in a modular fashion and not all at once is a key to success.

Clutch asked Josh and Lele about costs in utilizing cloud technologies. Lele explained that the cost will vary based on what the company needs to do with its cloud infrastructure. Josh went on to add that companies need to properly evaluate their options in order to determine what is best. Also, if one is in position to architect their infrastructure in order to take advantage of the cloud, they should do so.

Next, Josh and Lele were asked about how they go about choosing the right platform for projects. They made sure to stress that needs vary for every client, and that the right platform for one client may not be the right platform for another. The two agreed that AWS has at times been an appealing option due to its many features. For projects where fewer features are necessary and cost is tight, Rackspace has been a good option. Josh and Lele also touched on the support that the various cloud technologies offer, and their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, Josh and Lele were asked to rate different platforms in terms of functionality, ease of use, response time, whether they would recommend the service, and what their satisfaction level has been.
