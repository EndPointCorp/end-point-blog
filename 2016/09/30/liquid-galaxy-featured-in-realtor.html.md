[Liquid Galaxy](https://liquidgalaxy.endpoint.com/) was recently featured in Realtor Magazine as new mapping technology that can benefit real estate companies. The article was featured online as well as in their print magazine. The online version can be found [here](http://realtormag.realtor.org/technology/feature/article/2016/09/new-mapping-tech-can-help-attract-clients). 

The article discussed how new innovations in mapping technology have led to new and exciting tools for real estate professionals to connect with current and future clients. Liquid Galaxy is a prime example of that. 

In a section titled “Amping up Office Offerings,” author Meg White writes “Web traffic is nice, but what about bringing more clients into the office? Maybe it’s time your brokerage built its very own map room. New York–based tech development company End Point has installed its Liquid Galaxy mapping display at dozens of companies worldwide. The first real estate firm to use Liquid Galaxy was CBRE, followed by other commercial firms, including ProLogis and JLL.”

The article continues by mentioning the Liquid Galaxy’s standard configuration of an array of 55-inch screens. Users have the ability to enter any address they’d like, as well as explore the world using a 3D joystick. In addition, the Liquid Galaxy can display key information to real estate investors and developers, like population density and nearby transportation. The system is a great eye-catcher and crowd-pleaser, and outside of VR technology and actually being inside a building, it’s the only large and immersive way to view a new property.

Real estate is one of the industries that effectively utilizes Liquid Galaxy the most. If you would like to learn more, you can visit our [Liquid Galaxy website](https://liquidgalaxy.endpoint.com/) or [contact us here](https://liquidgalaxy.endpoint.com/#contact).
