The National Weather Center (NWC) recently deployed a 7-screen Liquid Galaxy system in their Visitor’s Center, the first room visitors see as they enter the breathtaking NWC building on the University of Oklahoma campus in Norman, Oklahoma. 

Compared to some temporary installations that require actual architectural changes to the building, this installation was fairly simple because the open space was already available and we did not need to coordinate with building contractors.

In order to most efficiently assemble and test the Liquid Galaxy, our build, customization, and testing staff in Tennessee prepared the Liquid Galaxy in accordance with the details requested by the NWC. They then shipped the Liquid Galaxy in our custom flight cases that protect the system in transit. 

Our expert installer, Will Plaut, flew on site to Oklahoma and got the electrical, power, networking, frames, navigation podium, and calibration aligned. Will has assembled Liquid Galaxy systems in four different countries and is very comfortable with system assembly.

Content has already been built for the system, including scenes with videos and supplementary weather information, as well as a weather game created specifically for use on the Liquid Galaxy system. The weather game is a weather simulator, designed as a competition between teams representing The Ohio State Buckeyes and The University of Oklahoma Sooners. Members of various departments dropped by during installation to see the system, and inquired as to whether they too would be able to build their own content to show on the system.

Thus far, the Liquid Galaxy at NWC has been a great success. NWC’s Liquid Galaxy is a popular exhibit that is getting utilized by many in the building.  The day after installation, the University’s Provost and Board of Regents came to see the system firsthand and were pleased with the new exhibit. 

We are delighted with how this installation turned out. If you would like to learn more, you can visit our [Liquid Galaxy website](https://liquidgalaxy.endpoint.com/) or [contact us here](https://liquidgalaxy.endpoint.com/#contact).
