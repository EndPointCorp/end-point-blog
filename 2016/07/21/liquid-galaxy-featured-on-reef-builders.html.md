The [Liquid Galaxy](https://liquidgalaxy.endpoint.com/) was recently featured on the front page of [Reef Builders](https://reefbuilders.com/), the original and longest running saltwater fish blog and a leading source of aquarium news. Reef Builders writer Nicole Helgason wrote the story, which can be found [here](https://reefbuilders.com/2016/07/08/liquid-galaxy-end-point/).

The Liquid Galaxy is an amazing tool for aquariums (not to mention other kinds of museums, offices, educational institutions, and more) around the world. It is a particularly effective for aquariums due to the underwater imagery shown on the system, as well as End Point’s Content Management System that allows users the opportunity to tell underwater “stories” with supporting images, videos, and content.  We have deployed to aquariums and science museums throughout the US, Europe, and East Asia.

The Liquid Galaxy lets visitors explore coral reefs and underwater environments the exact same way they navigate Street View (it’s the same app and data set) with a full set of screens to give a totally immersive experience. While viewing the dazzling immersive display, the user can make use of the Liquid Galaxy touchpad and 3D joystick to look around and navigate through the display.

A video demonstrating how the Liquid Galaxy is utilized in aquariums can be found below. If you’re interested in learning more about Liquid Galaxy for your aquarium, please [contact us here](/contact) for more information.
