*Liz Flyntz: What are your preferred tools for producing deliverables?  What are some tools you would like to try?*

Trey McKay: The deliverables themselves, and the tools with which to create them, are heavily context-dependent. Meaning that different stages of the design process require different deliverables. The general rule of thumb that I've adopted for my work is to stay as low-fidelity as possible, for as long as possible. The goal there being that you end up staying much more agile and open to change, spend less time chasing down details that may not matter in the long run, and more likely to end up with something useful.  

Because low-fi tools require a small amount of time and energy, you as a designer don't feel any attachment to them if you need to scrap your idea or start in a new direction. The more time you put into details on something, the more of an emotional attachment you build to it, and the less open you are to change (bad!). So it's important, especially early in the design process, to work as low-fi as possible. Move quickly, explore lots of directions, and then over time you can refine your ideas as you move into higher-fidelity mediums like wireframes or comps.

When I make medium-fidelity wireframes, I use Sketch. I prefer Sketch over tools like Photoshop or Illustrator for doing wireframes because it was designed from the ground-up for doing UI design. There are a lot less unnecessary tools, and there are a ton of useful plug-ins around the internet for doing various things in Sketch specific to UI design, and generally I've found my workflow to be vastly more efficient as a result. Photoshop in specific feels incredibly slow and inefficient for my process because it is a photo manipulation tool at it's core. 

Lastly, my preferred hi-def tool is working directly in the browser. Working straight in HTML and CSS (we use Scss at Shapeways), I'm able to leverage the extensive front-end framework we've already built. We've got tons of CSS already written which helps me move as fast as possible, and really see exactly what the end result will be in a variety of browsers, on different devices, etc. CSS makes working with repetitive elements really efficient, as you can make broad, sweeping changes all in one go. Gone are the days of the "pixel-perfect" Photoshop comp. Go directly from medium fidelity wireframe to hi-fidelity prototype in your browser, and profit. 

*LF: What’s special about the UI needs of a highly specialized product/userbase like your company?*

TM: One of the biggest challenges that we face here is designing for the sheer variability of what our users can create, buy and sell on our platform. We have an e-commerce marketplace that functions on the top-level like many others, but we're also responsible for manufacturing and shipping those products. The things you buy on our marketplace may never have existed before, and that's a very special thing to design for.

From a UI-design perspective, that forces you to account for a potentially unlimited amount of edge-cases. How do you design interfaces that serve people selling insanely complex mathematical art pieces that are generated from algorithms, high-end designer jewelry, and also scale miniatures? How do you design shop management interfaces for selling those same products in any of our 50+ 3D printing materials? It forces you to design for scale, flexibility, and inherent usability. There's no room for "fluff" or unnecessary interface elements.

*LF: You are in-house, so I think that makes a difference; have you worked for clients before?  What do you do when there is a mismatch between clients’ design wants and what you feel are user requirements?*

TM: I have worked for clients pretty extensively actually. I think there's a correlation for in-house folks when they're working with partner teams like marketing, business, etc. Generally, when there's a mismatch between what a client wants, and what a user needs, it's my job to educate my client the best I can as to why the user needs that, and why it's important for the success of the project. I always feel that it's my responsibility to be the loudest voice for the end-user. I generally try to be firm with clients, because in most situations, happy users make for happy clients. Hard to argue that! Though as with all things, there's always a tradeoff to be found in most situations.
