title: We are bigger than VR gear - Liquid Galaxy
---



Nowadays, virtual reality is one of the hottest topics in tech, with VR enabling users to enter immersive environments built up by computer technology.  I attended Mobile World Congress 2016 a few weeks ago, and it was interesting to see people sit next to one another and totally ignore one another while they were individually immersed in their own virtual reality worlds.

When everyone is so addicted to their little magic boxes, they tend to lose their connections with people around them. End Point has developed a new experience in which users can watch and share their virtually immersive world together. This experience is called the [Liquid Galaxy](https://liquidgalaxy.endpoint.com/).

When a user stands in front of Liquid Galaxy and is surrounded by a multitude of huge screens arranged in a semicircle, he puts not only his eyes but his whole body into an unprecedented 3D space. These screens are big enough to cover the audience’s entire peripheral vision and bring great visual stimulation from all directions. When using the Liquid Galaxy system, the users become fully immersed in the system and the imagery they view.

This digital chamber can be considered a sort of VR movie theater, where an audience can enjoy the same content, and probably the same bucket of popcorn! While this setup makes the Liquid Galaxy a natural fit for any sort of exhibit, many End Point employees have also watched full length feature movies on the system during our monthly Movie Night at our Headquarters office in Manhattan. This sort of shared experience is not something that is possible on typical VR, because unlike VR the Liquid Galaxy is serving a larger audience and presenting stories in a more interactive way.

For most meetings, exhibitions, and other special occasions, the Liquid Galaxy helps to provide an amazing and impactful experience  to the audience. Any scenario can be built for users to explore, and geospatial data sets can be  presented immersively.

With the ability to serve a group of people simultaneously, Liquid Galaxy increases the impact of content presentation and brings a revolutionary visual experience to its audiences.
