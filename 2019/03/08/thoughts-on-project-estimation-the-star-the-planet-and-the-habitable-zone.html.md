Whenever we are working on a feature, planning a milestone or a project, there is always a discussion about the cost and time needed.  In most cases there are three main actors: the client, the manager, and the programmer(s). Let’s use the analogy of a star system, where the client is the star everything orbits around, the work to be done is the planet , and the programmers  are the biosphere. The closer we are to the star, the closer we are to the exact requests of the client.
 
Everything orbits around the star - the client -, whose activity produces the energy, ensuring that there is a planet at all. If the planet – the project – is too close to the star, it will burn out quickly and evaporate, yet, if the planet is too far away, then the relationship between the star and the planet, or the client and the project (from our perspective) will freeze out. There is a so called habitable zone, where the planet, or the project can benefit of the energy of the star. 

First the habitable zone should be found, a concept of the project which is close-enough to the client’s desires, but in an achievable manner, so biosphere can coexist with the star system, shaping the planet.
 
Whenever we create an estimation, we need to differentiate parts of the problem into two main categories. The first category is the subset of the problem where we can accurately foresee what is to be done and we can accurately estimate the needed time. The second category is the subset of the problem where we have open questions. It’s good to offer the client alternatives: we could do a vague estimation for the problems where we have open questions, or we can do research to gather further knowledge and  increase the subset of problems where we foresee the solution. In general:
 
```T = (T(Known) + T(Unkown) + T(Unforeseen)) * HR```
 
T(Known) is the total time we estimate for the problems for which we mostly already know the solution. T(Unkown) is the total time we estimate for the problems for which we have open questions, the answer of which directly affects the time we need. T(Unforeseen) is the total time we are to work on problems we cannot foresee before the start of the work. HR is the Habitable Ratio we multiply the time with. For example, if HR = 1.3, then we estimate the time of the work with 30% higher for the client than the amount of time we think we can complete the problem. The reason we need such a ratio is that T(Unkown) and T(Unforeseen) in reality can be higher than in our estimation. If we estimate a time to the client which is around or less than the time we think we can successfully finish our work, then the work will potentially be a stressful rush and if it is more than the time we estimated to the client, then we lose from our hard earned reputation. In this case we will either be at the edge of the habitable zone towards the star, or even between the star and the habitable zone. It is the perfect recipe to burn out quickly.
 
On the other hand if we exaggerate T, then the client will think that costs will get out of control. In this case even though we can surely fulfill the estimation, we are outside of the habitable zone, we will not get enough energy from our star to enable a biosphere to live on the planet.
 
So, the rules we would like to adhere to are:

- reliability of the estimation
- being open when we cannot achieve the precision we would like for the estimation
- give alternatives when something takes too much energy if possible
- pleasantly surprise the client with completing the work before the deadline both in terms of agreed hours and calendaristic end date whenever we are able to
- be detailed about what and how was done, so, in the case when the work requires more time than we thought the client will understand the reason

Communication is often not counted into the estimation and there could be other things we may forget. I think it’s a good idea to think about what may have been forgotten before we send an estimation.
