[Awesomplete](https://leaverou.github.io/awesomplete/) is an “Ultra lightweight, customizable, simple autocomplete widget with zero dependencies, built with modern standards for modern browsers.”

Awesomplete caught my attention when I was looking for a lightweight autocomplete implementation to add to an existing, heavily styled form in a Vue.js single-​file component. There are no fewer than 10 options on the [Awesome Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue#autocomplete) list of autocomplete libraries, but many of them brought their own dependencies or custom styling and I was looking for something simpler to add autocomplete features to my form.

I have created a [live JSFiddle demo](https://jsfiddle.net/endpointpatrick/9czpvo58/9/) showing an implementation of Awesomplete in a Vue.js app, but the remainder of this post contains more details about adding Awesomplete to a single-​file component in a larger Vue application.

Here is a screenshot and sample code for a simplified version of the Vue single-​file component that I was working with:

<img src="/blog/2019/01/adding-awesomplete-to-vue-components/form.png" alt="Simple form" />

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <h2>Search by Name</h2>
    <p>
      <em>
        Options: {{ names.join(', ') }}
      </em>
    </p>

    <form>
      <input
        id="name-input"
        placeholder="Enter a name"
        type="text"
      >
    </form>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data () {
    return {
      names: [
        'Colin Creevey',
        'Seamus Finnigan',
        'Lee Jordan'
      ]
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

In my actual application I was populating the data object with API data via [vue-apollo](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-apollo), but I’ve hard-​coded the array of strings here for simplicity.

Adding autocomplete to my form with Awesomplete was as easy as adding the package to my project with `yarn awesomplete` and then updating the Vue component to load the library and attach it to my form:

```html
<template>
  ...
</template>

<script>
import Awesomplete from 'awesomplete'

export default {
  data () {
    return {
      names: [
        'Colin Creevey',
        'Seamus Finnigan',
        'Lee Jordan'
      ]
    }
  },
  mounted () {
    let input = document.getElementById('name-input')
    new Awesomplete(input, { minChars: 3, list: this.names })

    input.addEventListener('awesomplete-select', (e) => {
      alert(`selected ${e.text.value}`)
    })
  }
}
</script>
```

All of the Awesomplete work is taking place in the component’s `mounted()` function, where the form input is stored in a variable, passed to a new Awesomplete instance along with an options object, and then a listener function is added to take some action when the user has selected an autocomplete value. That action would typically be a form submission, but I am just using an alert for the purposes of this demo.

Awesomplete has many options for [customization](https://leaverou.github.io/awesomplete/#customization) and is [well-documented](https://leaverou.github.io/awesomplete/#advanced-examples) in general. I encourage anyone looking to add autocomplete features to their projects to give it a try; I was impressed by how easily I was able to use it to add autocomplete features that integrated well with my project.
