From Thursday to Saturday I backpacked with a friend and some of our kids into Alaska Basin (in the Tetons, in Wyoming), saw some beautiful scenery, and became reacquainted with the other kind of bugs for a while.

The lake is Sunset Lake, where we went Friday night. I frolicked in the snowmelt water and lost my new glasses in the silt, but came back the next morning and found them after wading out 20 feet or so. It was a great trip.
