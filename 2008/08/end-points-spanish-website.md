We’ve had a [Spanish version of our website](http://es.endpoint.com/) for about a year now, and we keep the content there current with our main English website. We haven’t promoted it much, so I figured I’d mention it here and see if any English speakers feel like checking it out. :) We currently have only a few Spanish speakers at End Point, and if a non-English-speaker calls our main office, it may take a bit of shuffling to route the caller to the right person.

But more to the point, we’ve done a few interesting multilingual projects. One of them is a private business-to-business website localized in US English, UK English, French, Canadian French, German, Italian, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, and Spanish. We’re experienced with popular character set encodings and Unicode in web protocols, Postgres and MySQL databases, Perl, and Ruby. We’re always interested in taking on more such projects as they tend to be challenging and fun.
