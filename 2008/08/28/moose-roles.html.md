Perl programmers,

Moose roles give a really nice way of maximizing code reuse within an object system, while favoring composition over inheritance.  This makes for shallower inheritance trees, reduced method dispatch spaghettification, and a more comprehensible, maintainable, extensible codebase overall.  Revel in the glory.

That is all.
