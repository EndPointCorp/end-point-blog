Friday evening I did a presentation on and demonstration of our “development camps” at the [2008 Utah Open Source Conference](https://web.archive.org/web/20080901001212/http://2008.utosc.com/pages/home/) in Salt Lake City. Attendees seemed to get what camps are all about, asked some good questions, and we had some good conversations afterwards. You can read my [presentation abstract](https://web.archive.org/web/20080901001218/http://2008.utosc.com:80/presentation/81/) and [my slides and notes](http://www.devcamps.org/camps-presentation-20080829/), and more will be coming soon at the [camps website](http://www.devcamps.org/).

I’ll post more later on some talks I attended and enjoyed at the conference.
