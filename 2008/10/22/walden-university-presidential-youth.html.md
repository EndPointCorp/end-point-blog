title: Walden University Presidential Youth Debate goes live
---

This afternoon was the launch of Walden University's [Presidential Youth Debate](http://www.youthdebate2008.org/) website, which features 14 questions and video responses from Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain. The video responses are about 44 minutes long overall.

The site has a fairly simple feature set but is technologically interesting for us. It was developed by Dan Collis-Puro and Ethan Rowe using [Radiant](http://radiantcms.org/), [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/), [CentOS Linux](http://www.centos.org/), [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/), [Phusion Passenger](http://www.modrails.com/), [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/), [Varnish](http://www.varnish-cache.org/), and [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

Nice work, guys!
