Spree 0.4.0 was officially released today. Spree is a complete open source ecommerce platform written for Ruby on Rails. While Spree technically works “out of the box” as a fully functional store, it is really intended to serve as a strong foundation for a custom commerce solution. Like Rails, Spree is considered to be [“opinionated software”](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/developer/about.html#opinionated-commerce), and it does not seek to solve 100% of the commerce needs of all possible clients. Developers are able to provide the missing functionality by using the powerful [extension system](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/developer/extensions_tutorial.html).

The current release of Spree contains many signficant improvements from the previous 0.2.0 release. Some of the highlights include:

- Rails 2.1 support
- SEO improvements
- Security enhancements
- Public assets for extensions
- Mailer templates for extensions
- VAT inclusive pricing
- Taxonomy

Most open source projects in the Rails space are maintained by a single individual and tend to be limited in scope. For Spree we seek to create a large and healthy open source community similar to the ones found in more mature languages and frameworks. The Spree project has received contributions from over twenty different developers and has been translated into five additional languages.

I created Spree in late 2007, and End Point later became an official sponsor of the Spree project and employs me and several other Spree contributors.
