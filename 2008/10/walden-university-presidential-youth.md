This afternoon was the launch of Walden Universityâ€™s [Presidential Youth Debate](http://www.youthdebate2008.org/) website, which features 14 questions and video responses from Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain. The video responses are about 44 minutes long overall.

The site has a fairly simple feature set but is technologically interesting for us. It was developed by Dan Collis-Puro and Ethan Rowe using [Radiant](http://radiantcms.org/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [CentOS Linux](https://www.centos.org/), [Ruby on Rails](https://www.rubyonrails.org/), [Phusion Passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/), [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/), [Varnish](https://www.varnish-cache.org/), and [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

Nice work, guys!
